<h2><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To-day</span> in warfare all the niceties
of old-world tactics are fallen into contempt.&nbsp; No word of
outworks, ravelins, of mamelons, of counter-scarps, of glacis,
fascines; none of the terms by means of which Vauban obscured his
art, are even mentioned.&nbsp; Armies fall to and blow such
brains as they may have out of each other&rsquo;s heads without
so much as a salute.&nbsp; And so of literature, your &ldquo;few
first words,&rdquo; your &ldquo;avant-propos,&rdquo; your nice
approaches to the reader, giving him beforehand some taste of
what is to follow, have also fallen into disuse.&nbsp; The man of
genius (and in no age has self-dubbed genius called out so loud
in every street, and been accepted at its own appraisement)
stuffs you his epoch-making book full of the technicalities of
some obscure or half-forgotten trade, and rattles on at once,
sans introduction, twenty knots an hour, like a torpedo
boat.&nbsp; No preface, dedication, not even <a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>an
apology <i>pro existenti&acirc; ejus</i> intervening betwixt the
bewildered public and the full power of his wit.&nbsp; A
graceless way of doing things, and not comparable to the slow
approach by &ldquo;prefatory words,&rdquo; &ldquo;censura,&rdquo;
&ldquo;dedication,&rdquo; by means of which the writers of the
past had half disarmed the critic ere he had read a line.&nbsp; I
like to fancy to myself the progress of a fight in days gone by,
with marching, countermarching, manoeuvring, so to speak, for the
weather-gauge, and then the general engagement all by the book of
arithmetic, and squadrons going down like men upon a chessboard
after nice calculation, and like gentlemen.</p>
<p>Who, hidden in a wood, watching a nymph about to bathe, would
care to see her strip off her &ldquo;duds&rdquo; like an
umbrella-case, and bounce into the river like a
water-rat?&mdash;a lawn upon the grass, a scarf hung on a bush, a
petticoat rocked by the wind upon the sward, then the shy trying
of the water with the naked feet, and lastly something flashing
in the sun which you could hardly swear you had seen, so rapidly
it passed into the stream, would most enchant the gaze of the
rapt watcher hidden behind his tree.&nbsp; And so of literature,
wheedle me by degrees, your reader to your book, as did the
giants of the past in graceful <a name="pageix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. ix</span>preface, dedication, or what do you
call it, that got the readers, so to speak, into the book before
they were aware.&nbsp; It seems to me, a world all void of grace
must needs be cruel, for cruelty and grace go not together, and
perhaps the hearts of the pig-tailed, pipe-clayed generals of the
past were not more hard than are the hearts of their tweed-clad
descendants who now-a-days blow you a thousand savages to
paradise, and then sit down to lunch.</p>
<p>Let there be no mistake; the writer and the reader are sworn
foes.&nbsp; The writer labouring for bread, or hopes of fame,
from idleness, from too much energy, or from that uncontrollable
dance of St. Vitus in the muscles of the wrist which prompts so
many men to write (the Lord knows why), works, blots, corrects,
rewrites, revises, and improves; then publishes, and for the most
part is incontinently damned.&nbsp; Then comes the reader
cavalierly, as the train shunts at Didcot, or puffs and snorts
into Carlisle, and gingerly examining the book says it is
rubbish, and that he wonders how people who should have something
else to do, find time to spend their lives in writing trash.</p>
<p>I take it that there is a modesty of mind as deep implanted in
the soul of man as is the <a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>supergrafted post-Edenian modesty of
the body; which latter, by the way, so soon is lost, restraints
of custom or convention laid aside.</p>
<p>Who that would strip his clothes off, and walk down
Piccadilly, even if the day were warm (the police all drunk or
absent), without some hesitation, and an announcement of his
purpose, say, in the columns of the <i>Morning Post</i>?</p>
<p>Therefore, why strip the soul stark naked to the public gaze
without some hesitation and due interval, by means of which to
make folk understand that which you write is what you think you
feel; part of yourself, a part, moreover, which once given out
can never be recalled?</p>
<p>So of the sketches in this book, most of them treat of scenes
seen in that magic period, youth, when things impress themselves
on the imagination more sharply than in after years; and the
scenes too have vanished; that is, the countries where they
passed have all been changed, and now-a-days are full of
barbed-wire fences, advertisements, and desolation, the
desolation born of imperfect progress.&nbsp; The people, too, I
treat of, for the most part have disappeared; being born unfit
for progress, it has passed over them, and their place is
occupied by worthy men who cheat to <a name="pagexi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xi</span>better purpose, and more
scientifically.&nbsp; Therefore, I, writing as a man who has not
only seen but lived with ghosts, may perhaps find pardon for this
preface, for who would run in heavily and dance a hornpipe on the
turf below which sleep the dead?&nbsp; And if I am not pardoned
for my hesitation, dislike, or call it what you will, to give
these little sketches to the world without preamble, after my
fashion, I care not overmuch.</p>
<p>In the phantasmagoria we call the world, most things and men
are ghosts, or at the best but ghosts of ghosts, so vaporous and
unsubstantial that they scarcely cast a shadow on the
grass.&nbsp; That which is most abiding with us is the
recollection of the past, and . . . hence this preface.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CRUZ
ALTA</h2>
<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Pasted
into an old scrap-book, chiefly filled with newspaper cuttings
from Texan and Mexican newspapers containing accounts of Indian
fights, the prowess of different horses (notably of a celebrated
&ldquo;claybank,&rdquo; which carried the mail-rider from El Paso
to Oakville, Arizona), and interspersed with advertisements of
strayed animals, pictures of Gauchos, Indians, Chilians,
Brazilians, and Gambusinos, is an old coffee-coloured business
card.&nbsp; On it is set forth, that Francisco Cardozo de
Carvallo is the possessor of a &ldquo;Grande Armazem de Fazendas,
ferragems, drojas, chapeos, miudezas, e objectos de fantasia e de
modas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the above, &ldquo;Com grande reduccao nos
pre&ccedil;os.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then occurs the significant
adverten&ccedil;a, &ldquo;Mas A Dinheiro,&rdquo; and the address
Rua do Commercio, No. 77.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cruz
Alta</span>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Often</span> on winter nights when all the
air is filled with whirling leaves dashing against the panes,
when through the house sweep gusts of wind making the passages
unbearable with cold, the rooms disconsolate, and the whole place
feel eerie and ghostlike as the trees creak, groan and labour,
like a ship at sea, I take the scrap-book down.</p>
<p>In it are many things more interesting by far to me at certain
times than books or papers, or than the conversation of my valued
friends; almost as great a consolation as is tobacco to a bruised
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>mind; and
then I turn the pages over with delight tinged with that
melancholy which is the best part of remembrance.</p>
<p>So amongst tags of poetry as Joaquim Miller&rsquo;s lines
&ldquo;For those who fail,&rdquo; the advertisement for my
fox-terrier Jack, the &ldquo;condemndest little buffler&rdquo;
the Texans called him, couched in the choicest of Castilian, and
setting forth his attributes, colour and name, and offering five
dollars to any one who would apprehend and take him to the
Callejon del Espiritu Santo, Mexico, curious and striking
outsides of match-boxes, one entire series illustrating the
&ldquo;Promessi Sposi&rdquo;; of scraps, detailing news of Indian
caciques long since dead, a lottery-ticket of the State of
Louisiana, passes on &ldquo;busted&rdquo; railways, and the like,
is this same coffee-coloured card.</p>
<p>I cannot remember that I was a great dealer at the emporium,
the glories of which the card sets forth, except for cigarettes
and &ldquo;Rapadura&rdquo;; that is, raw sugar in a little cake
done up in maize-leaves, matches, and an occasional glass of
white Brazilian rum.</p>
<p>Still during two long months the place stood to me in lieu of
club, and in it I used to meet occasional German
&ldquo;Fazenderos,&rdquo; merchants from Surucaba, and officers
on the march from San Paulo to Rio Grande; and there I used to
lounge, waiting for customers to buy a &ldquo;Caballada&rdquo; of
some hundred horses, which a friend and I had <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>brought with
infinite labour from the plains of Uruguay.&nbsp; Thinking upon
the strange and curious types I used to meet, clad for the most
part in loose black Turkish trousers, broad-brimmed felt hats
kept in their place by a tasselled string beneath the chin, in
real or sham vicu&ntilde;a ponchos, high patent-leather boots,
sewn in patterns with red thread; upon the horses with silver
saddles and reins, securely tied to posts outside the door, and
on the ceaseless rattle of spurs upon the bare brick floors which
made a sort of obligato accompaniment to the monotonous music of
the guitar, full twenty years fall back.</p>
<p>Yet still the flat-roofed town, capital of the district in Rio
Grande known as Encima de la Sierra, the stopping-place for the
great droves of mules which from the Banda Oriental and Entre
Rios are driven to the annual fair at Surucaba; the stodgy
Brazilian countrymen so different from the Gauchos of the River
Plate; the negroes at that time slaves; the curious vegetation,
and the feeling of being cut off from all the world, are fresh as
yesterday.</p>
<p>Had but the venture turned out well, no doubt I had forgotten
it, but to have worked for four long months driving the horses
all the day through country quite unknown to me, sitting the most
part of each night upon my horse on guard, or riding slowly round
and round the herd, eating jerked beef, and sleeping, often wet,
upon the ground, to <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>lose my money, has fixed the whole adventure on my memory
for life.</p>
<p>Failure alone is interesting.</p>
<p>Successful generals with their hands scarce dry from the blood
of half-armed foes; financiers, politicians; those who rise,
authors whose works run to a dozen editions in a year: the men
who go to colonies with or without the indispensable half-crown
and come back rich, to these we give our greetings in the
market-place; we make them knights, marking their children with
the father&rsquo;s bourgeois brand: we marvel at their fortune
for a brief space, and make them doctors of civil law, exposing
them during the process to be insulted by our undergraduates,
then they drop out of recollection and become uninteresting, as
nature formed their race.</p>
<p>But those who fail after a glorious fashion, Raleigh,
Cervantes, Chatterton, Camoens, Blake, Claverhouse, Lovelace,
Alcibiades, Parnell, and the last unknown deck-hand who, diving
overboard after a comrade, sinks without saving him: these
interest us, at least they interest those who, cursed with
imagination, are thereby doomed themselves to the same failure as
their heroes were.&nbsp; The world is to the unimaginative, for
them are honours, titles, rank and ample waistbands; foolish
phylacteries broad as trade union banners; their own esteem and
death to sound of Bible leaves fluttered by sorrowing friends,
with the sure hope of waking <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>up immortal in a new world on the same
pattern as the world that they have left.</p>
<p>After a wretched passage down the coast, we touched at Rio,
and in the Rua Direita, no doubt now called Rio Primero de Mayo
or some other revolutionary date, we saw a Rio Grandense soldier
on a fine black horse.&nbsp; As we were going to the River Plate
to make our fortunes, my companion asked me what such a horse was
worth, and where the Brazilian Government got their
remounts.&nbsp; I knew no horses of the kind were bred nearer
than Rio Grande, or in Uruguay, and that a horse such as the
trooper rode, might in the latter country be worth an
ounce.&nbsp; We learned in Rio that his price was eighty dollars,
and immediately a golden future rose before our eyes.&nbsp; What
could be easier than in Uruguay, which I knew well and where I
had many friends (now almost to a man dead in the revolutions or
killed by rum), to buy the horses and drive them overland to the
Brazilian capital?</p>
<p>We were so confident of the soundness of our scheme that I
believe we counted every hour till the boat put to sea.</p>
<p>Not all the glories of the Tijuca with its view across the bay
straight into fairyland, the red-roofed town, the myriad islets,
the tall palm-tree avenue of Botafogo, the tropic trees and
butterflies, and the whole wondrous panorama spread at our feet,
contented us.</p>
<p>During the voyage to the River Plate we planned <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the thing well
out, and talked it over with our friends.&nbsp; They, being
mostly of our age, found it well reasoned, and envied us, they
being due at banks and counting-houses, and other places where no
chance like ours of making money, could be found.&nbsp; Arrived
in Buenos Ayres, a cursed chance called us to Bahia Blanca upon
business, but though we had a journey of about a thousand miles
to make through territory just wasted by the Indians and in which
at almost every house a man or two lay dead, we counted it as
nothing, for we well knew on our return our fortunes were
assured.</p>
<p>And so the autumn days upon the Arroyo de los Huesos seemed
more glorious than autumn days in general, even in that climate
perhaps the most exhilarating of the world.&nbsp; Horses went
better, &ldquo;mat&eacute;&rdquo; was hotter in the mouth, the
pulperia ca&ntilde;a seemed more tolerable, and the
&ldquo;China&rdquo; girls looked more desirable than usual, even
to philosophers who had their fortunes almost as good as
made.</p>
<p>Our business in the province of Buenos Ayres done, and by this
time I have forgotten what it was, we sold our horses, some of
the best I ever saw in South America, for whatever they would
fetch, and in a week found ourselves in Durazno, a little town in
Uruguay, where in the camps surrounding, horses and mules were
cheap.</p>
<p>About a league outside the town, and in a wooded elbow of the
river Yi, lived our friend Don Guillermo.&nbsp; <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>I myself years
before had helped to build his house; and in and out of season,
no matter if I arrived upon a &ldquo;pingo&rdquo; shining with
silver gear, or on a &ldquo;mancaron&rdquo; with an old saddle
topped by a ragged sheepskin, I was a welcome guest.</p>
<p>Ah! Don Guillermo, you and your brother Don Tomas rise also
through the mist of twenty years.</p>
<p>Catholics, Scotchmen, and gentlemen, kindly and hospitable,
bold riders and yet so religious that, though it must have been a
purgatory to them as horsemen, they used to trudge on foot to
mass on Sunday, swimming the Yi when it was flooded, with their
clothes and missals on their heads, may God have pardoned
you.</p>
<p>Not that the sins of either of them could have been great, or
of the kind but that the briefest sojourn in purgatory should not
have wiped them out.</p>
<p>To those rare Catholic families in Scotland an old-world
flavour clings.&nbsp; When Knox and that &ldquo;lewid
monk,&rdquo; the Regent Murray, all agog for progress and
so-called purer worship, pestered and bothered Scotland into a
change of faith, those few who clung to Catholicism seemed to
become repositories of the traditions of an older world.</p>
<p>Heaven and hell, no resting-place for the weaker souls
between, have rendered Scotland a hard place for the ordinary man
who wants his purgatory, even if by another name.&nbsp; Surely
our Scottish theologians <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>had done well, although they heated
up our hell like a glass furnace, to leave us purgatory; that is
if &ldquo;Glesca&rdquo; be not purgatory enough even for those
who, like North Britons, have no doubt on any subject either in
heaven above, or in the earth below.&nbsp; So to the house of Don
Guillermo&mdash;even the name has now escaped me, though I see
it, mud-built and thatched with &ldquo;paja,&rdquo; standing on a
little sandy hill, surrounded on two sides by wood, on the others
looking straight out upon the open &ldquo;camp&rdquo;&mdash;hot
foot we came.&nbsp; Riding upon two strayed horses known as
&ldquo;ajenos,&rdquo; bought for a dollar each in Durazno, we
arrived, carrying our scanty property in saddle-bags, rode to the
door, called out &ldquo;Hail, Mary!&rdquo; after the fashion of
the country and in deference to the religion of our hosts, which
was itself of so sincere a caste that every one attempted to
conform to it, as far as possible, whilst in their house;
received the answer &ldquo;Without sin conceived&rdquo;; got off,
and straightway launched into a discussion of our plan.</p>
<p>Assembled in the house were Wycherley, Harrington and
Trevelyan, and other commentators, whose names have slipped my
mind.&nbsp; Some were &ldquo;estancieros,&rdquo; that is cattle
or sheep farmers; others again were loafers, all mostly men of
education, with the exception of Newfoundland Jack, a sailor, who
had left the navy in a hurry, after some peccadillo, but who,
once in the camp, took a high place amongst men, by his knowledge
of splicing, <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>making turks&rsquo; heads, and generally applying all
his acquired sea-lore to saddlery, and from a trick he had of
forcing home his arguments with a short knife, the handle fixed
on with a raw cow&rsquo;s tail, and which in using he threw from
hand to hand, and generally succeeded in burying deeply in his
opponent&rsquo;s chest.&nbsp; Our friends all liked the scheme,
pronounced it practical and businesslike, and, to show goodwill,
despatched a boy to town to bring a demijohn of ca&ntilde;a back
at full speed, instructing him to put it down to our account, not
to delay upon the way, and to be careful no one stole it at the
crossing of the Yi.</p>
<p>Long we sat talking, waiting for the advent of the boy, till
at last, seeing he would not come that night, and a thick mist
rising up from the river having warned us that the night was
wearing on, we spread our saddles on the floor, and went to
sleep.&nbsp; At daybreak, cold and miserable, the boy appeared,
bringing the ca&ntilde;a in a demijohn, and to our questions said
he had passed the river, hit the &ldquo;rincon,&rdquo; and heard
the dogs bark in the mist; but after trying for an hour could
never find the house.&nbsp; Then, thinking that his horse might
know the way, laid down the reins, and the horse took him
straight to the other horses, who, being startled at the sudden
apparition of their friend saddled and mounted in the dead of
night, vanished like spectres into the thickest of the fog.&nbsp;
Then tired of riding, after an hour or two, took off his saddle,
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and had
passed the night, as it appeared at daybreak, not a quarter of a
mile away.</p>
<p>Between the town and Don Guillermo&rsquo;s house there ran a
river called the Yi; just at the pass a &ldquo;balsa&rdquo;
plied, drawn over by stout ropes.&nbsp; On either side the
&ldquo;pass&rdquo; stood pulperias, that is camp-stores, where
gin and sardines, Vino Carlon, Yerba, and all the necessaries of
frontier life could be procured.&nbsp; Horses and cattle, mules
and troops of sheep passed all the day, and gamblers plied their
trade, whilst in some huts girls, known as &ldquo;Chinas,&rdquo;
watched the passers-by, loitering in deshabille before their
mare&rsquo;s hide doors, singing &ldquo;cielitos,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;gato,&rdquo; to the accompaniment of a guitar, or merely
shouting to the stranger, &ldquo;Che, si quieres cosa buena vente
por ac&aacute;.&rdquo;&nbsp; A half-Arcadian, half-Corinthian
place the crossing was; fights there were frequent, and a
&ldquo;Guapeton,&rdquo; that is, a pretty handler of his knife,
once kept things lively for a month or two, challenging all the
passers-by to fight, till luckily a Brazilian, going to the town,
put things in order with an iron-handled whip.</p>
<p>The owner of the &ldquo;balsa,&rdquo; one Eduardo Pe&ntilde;a,
cherished a half-romantic, half-antagonistic friendship for Don
Guillermo, speaking of him as &ldquo;muy Catolico,&rdquo;
admiring his fine seat upon a horse, and yet not understanding in
the least the qualities which made him a man of mark in all the
&ldquo;pagos&rdquo; from the Porongos to the Arazati.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Catolico,&rdquo; <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>with Pe&ntilde;a, was but a matter of
pure faith, and going to mass a work of supererogation; and
conduct such as the eschewal of the China ladies at the pass,
with abstinence from all excess in square-faced gin, dislike to
mont&eacute;, even with &ldquo;Sota en la puerta,&rdquo; and the
adversary with all his money staked upon another card, seemed to
him bigotry; for bigotry is after all not so much mere excess of
faith or want of tolerance, but a neglect to fall into the vices
of our friends.&nbsp; So, mounted on our two
&ldquo;agenos,&rdquo; one a jibber, the other a kicker at the
stirrup, and extremely hard to mount, we scoured the land.&nbsp;
Gauchos, Brazilians, negroes, troperos, cattle-farmers, each man
in the whole &ldquo;pago&rdquo; had at least a horse to
sell.&nbsp; Singly, driven, led, pulled unwillingly along in
raw-hide ropes, and sitting back like lapdogs walking in the
park, the horses came.&nbsp; We bought them all after much
bargaining, and then began to hunt about at farms, estancias, and
potreros, and to inquire on every side where horses could be
got.&nbsp; All the &ldquo;dead beats,&rdquo;
&ldquo;sancochos,&rdquo; buck-jumpers, wall-eyed and
broken-backed, we passed in a review.&nbsp; An English sailor
rode up to the place, dressed as a Gaucho, speaking but little
English, with a west-country twang.&nbsp; He, too, had horses,
which we bought, and the deal over, launched into the story of
his life.</p>
<p>It seemed that he had left a man-of-war some fifteen years
ago, married a native girl and settled down, and for ten years
had never met <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>an Englishman.&nbsp; In English, still a sailor, but in
Spanish, a gentleman, courteous and civil, and fit to take his
place with any one; full of fine compliments, and yet a
horse-coper; selling us three good horses, and one, that the
first time I mounted him kicked like a zebra, although our friend
had warranted him quite free from vice, well bitted, and the one
horse he had which he reserved in general for the saddle of his
wife.</p>
<p>In a few days we had collected sixty or seventy, and to make
all complete, a man arrived, saying that specially on our
account, thirteen wild horses, or horses that had run wild, had
been enclosed.&nbsp; He offered them on special terms, and we,
saddling at once, rode twelve or thirteen leagues to see them;
and after crossing a river, wading through a swamp, and winding
in and out through a thick wood for several miles, we reached his
house.&nbsp; There, in a strong corral, the horses were,
wild-eyed and furious, tails sweeping to the ground, manes to
their knees, sweating with fear, and trembling if any one came
near.&nbsp; One was a piebald dun, about eight years of age,
curly all over like a poodle; one Pampa, that is, black with a
head as if it had been painted white to the ears; behind them,
coal-black down to his feet, which, curiously enough, were all
four white.&nbsp; A third, Overo Azulejo, slate-coloured and
white; he was of special interest, for he had twisted in his mane
a large iron spur, and underneath a lump as large as an apple,
where the spur <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>had bumped upon his neck for years during his gallop
through the woods and plains.&nbsp; Each horse had some
peculiarity, most had been tame at one time, and were therefore
more to be dreaded than if they had been never mounted in their
lives.</p>
<p>As it was late when we arrived we tied our horses up and found
a ball in progress at the house.&nbsp; Braulio Islas was the
owner&rsquo;s name, a man of some position in the land, young and
unmarried, and having passed some years of his life in Monte
Video, where, as is usual, he had become a doctor either of law
or medicine; but the life had not allured him, and he had drifted
back to the country, where he lived, half as a Gaucho, half as a
&ldquo;Dotorcito,&rdquo; riding a wild horse as he were part of
him, and yet having a few old books, quoting dog Latin, and in
the interim studying international law, after the fashion of the
semi-educated in the River Plate.&nbsp; Fastening our horses to
long twisted green-hide ropes, we passed into the house.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Carne con cuero&rdquo; (meat cooked with the hide) was
roasting near the front-door on a great fire of bones.&nbsp;
Around it men sat drinking mat&eacute;, smoking and talking,
whilst tame ostriches peered into the fire and snapped up
anything within their reach; dogs without hair, looking like
pigs, ran to and fro, horses were tied to every post, fire-flies
darted about the trees; and, above all, the notes, sung in a high
falsetto voice of a most lamentable Paraguayan
&ldquo;triste,&rdquo; quavered in the night air and set the dogs
a-barking, when all <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>the company at stated intervals took up the refrain, and
chanted hoarsely or shrilly of the hardships passed by Lopez in
his great camp at Piray&uacute;.</p>
<p>Under the straw-thatched sheds whole cows and sheep were hung
up; and every one, when he felt hungry, cut a collop off and
cooked it in the embers, for in those days meat had no price, and
if you came up hungry to a house a man would say: &ldquo;There is
a lazo, and the cattle are feeding in a hollow half a league
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A harp, two cracked guitars, the strings repaired with strips
of hide, and an accordion, comprised the band.&nbsp; The girls
sat in a row, upon rush-seated chairs, and on the walls were
ranged either great bowls of grease in which wicks floated, or
homemade candles fixed on to nails, which left them free to
gutter on the dancers&rsquo; heads.&nbsp; The men lounged at the
door, booted and spurred, and now and then one walked up to the
girls, selected one, and silently began to dance a Spanish valse,
slowly and scarcely moving from the place, the hands stretched
out in front, and the girl with her head upon his shoulder, eyes
fast closed and looking like a person in a trance.&nbsp; And as
they danced the musicians broke into a harsh, wild song, the
dancers&rsquo; spurs rattled and jingled on the floor, and
through the unglazed and open windows a shrill fierce neigh
floated into the room from the wild horses shut in the
corral.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dulces,&rdquo; that is, those sweetmeats
made from the yolk of eggs, from almonds, and from <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>nuts, and
flavoured with cinnamon and caraways brought by the Moors to
Spain, and taken by the Spaniards to the Indies, with sticky
cakes, and vino seco circulated amongst the female guests.&nbsp;
The men drank gin, ate bread (a delicacy in the far-off
&ldquo;camp&rdquo;), or sipped their mat&eacute;, which, in its
little gourds and silver tube, gave them the appearance of
smoking some strange kind of pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Que bailen los Ingleses,&rdquo; and we had to acquit
ourselves as best we could, dancing a &ldquo;pericon,&rdquo; as
we imagined it, waving our handkerchiefs about to the delight of
all the lookers-on.&nbsp; Fashion decreed that, the dance over,
the &ldquo;cavalier&rdquo; presented his handkerchief to the girl
with whom he danced.&nbsp; I having a bad cold saw with regret my
new silk handkerchief pass to the hand of a mulatto girl, and
having asked her for her own as a remembrance of her beauty and
herself, received a home-made cotton cloth, stiff as a piece of
leather, and with meshes like a sack.</p>
<p>Leaving the dance, as Braulio Islas said, as more
&ldquo;conformable&rdquo; to Gauchos than to serious men we
started bargaining.&nbsp; After much talking we agreed to take
the horses for three dollars each, upon condition that in the
morning Islas and all his men should help us drive a league or
two upon the road.&nbsp; This settled, and the money duly paid,
we went to bed, that is, lay down upon our saddles under the
&ldquo;galpon.&rdquo;&nbsp; To early morning the guitars went on,
and rising just about day-break we found <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the revellers
saddling their horses to depart in peace.&nbsp; We learned with
pleasure there had been no fight, and then after a mat&eacute;
walked down to the corral.&nbsp; Knowing it was impossible to
drive the horses singly, after much labour we coupled them in
twos.&nbsp; I mounted one of them, and to my surprise, he did not
buck, but after three or four plunges went quietly, and we let
the others out.&nbsp; The bars were scarcely down when they all
scattered, and made off into the woods.&nbsp; Luckily all the
drivers were at hand, and after three or four hours&rsquo; hard
galloping we got them back, all except one who never reappeared;
and late in the evening reached Don Guillermo&rsquo;s house and
let our horses into a paddock fenced with strong posts of
&ntilde;andubay or Tala and bound together with pieces of raw
hide.</p>
<p>So for a week or two we passed our lives, collecting horses of
every shade and hue, wild, tame and bagualon, that is, neither
quite wild nor tame, and then, before starting, had to go to
&ldquo;La Justicia&rdquo; to get a passport with their attributes
and marks.</p>
<p>I found the Alcalde, one Quintin Perez, sitting at his door,
softening a piece of hide by beating on it with a heavy mallet of
&ntilde;andubay.&nbsp; He could not read, but was so far advanced
towards culture as to be able to sign his name and
rubricate.&nbsp; His rubric was most elaborate, and he informed
me that a signature was good, but that he thought a rubric more
authentic.&nbsp; Though he could not decipher <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>the document
I brought for signature, he scrutinized the horses&rsquo; marks,
all neatly painted in the margin, discussed each one of them, and
found out instantly some were from distant &ldquo;pagos,&rdquo;
and on this account, before the signature or rubric was appended,
in addition to the usual fee, I was obliged to &ldquo;speak a
little English to him,&rdquo; which in the River Plate is used to
signify the taking and receiving of that conscience money which
causes the affairs of justice to move pleasantly for all
concerned.&nbsp; Meanwhile my partner had gone to town (Durazno)
to arrange about the revision of the passport with the chief
authorities.&nbsp; Nothing moved quickly at that time in Uruguay;
so after waiting one or two days in town, without a word, he
quietly let loose his horse in a by-street at night to save his
keep, and casting about where he should leave his saddle, thought
that the cloak-room of the railway-station might be safe, because
the station-master was an Englishman.&nbsp; The saddle, having
silver stirrups and good saddle-cloths and silver-mounted reins
and bit, was worth more than the horse, which, being a stray, he
had bought for a couple of dollars, and was not anxious to
retain.</p>
<p>After a day or two of talk, and &ldquo;speaking
English,&rdquo; he wanted his saddle, and going to the station
found it gone.&nbsp; Not being up at that time in the ways of the
Republic, he informed the police, waited a day, then two days,
and found nothing done.&nbsp; Luckily, just at that time, I came
to town <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>and asked him if he had offered a reward.&nbsp; Hearing
he had not, we went down to see the Commissary of Police, and
found him sitting in his office training two cocks to
fight.&nbsp; A rustle and the slamming of a door just marked the
hurried exit of a lady, who must have been assisting at the
main.&nbsp; Compliments duly passed, cigarettes lighted and
mat&eacute; circulating, &ldquo;served&rdquo; by a negro soldier
in a ragged uniform with iron spurs upon his naked feet who stood
attention every time he passed the gourd in which the mat&eacute;
is contained to either of us, we plunged into our talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten dollars, Comissario.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or, fifteen, and a slight gratification
to the man who brings the saddle back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We settled at thirteen, and then the Commissary winked slowly,
and saying, &ldquo;This is not Europe,&rdquo; asked for a little
something for himself, received it, and calling to the negro,
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tio Gancho, get at once to horse, take with you one or
two men, and scour the &lsquo;pago&rsquo; till you bring this
saddle back.&nbsp; See that you find it, or I will have your
thumbs both broken as your toes are, by San Edovige and by the
Mother of our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look at Tio Gancho showed both his big toes had been broken
when a slave in Brazil, either to stop him walking, or, as the
Commissary thought, to help him to catch the stirrup, for he was
a noted rider of a redomon. <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a></p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Duly
next day the saddle was brought (so said the Commissary) into the
light of justice, and it then appeared one of the silver stirrups
had been lost.&nbsp; The Commissary was much annoyed, reproached
his men, being, as he said he was: &ldquo;Un hombre muy
honrado.&rdquo;&nbsp; After thinking the case well out, he
returned me two and a half dollars out of the thirteen I had
agreed to pay.&nbsp; Honour no doubt was satisfied upon both
sides, and a new silver stirrup cost ten dollars at the least;
but as the saddle was well worth sixty, we parted friends.&nbsp;
That is, we should have parted so had not the &ldquo;Hombre muy
honrado&rdquo; had another card to play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you want the thief detained?&rdquo; he
asked.&nbsp; And we, thinking to be magnanimous and to impress
him with our liberal ideas, said loftily&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;then I must
trouble you for thirty dollars more for the man&rsquo;s
maintenance, and for the gaoler&rsquo;s fee.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
was a stopper over all, and I said instantly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being ignorant of your laws, perhaps we have looked at
the man&rsquo;s offence too hardly, a week will do.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So after paying five dollars down, we invited the Commissary to
drink, and left him well knowing that we should not be out of
sight before the man would be released, and the five dollars be
applied strictly towards the up-keep of &ldquo;justice&rdquo; in
the <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Partido of the Yi.&nbsp; Months afterwards I heard the
culprit worked two days cutting down weeds with a machete in the
public square; then, tired of it, being &ldquo;un hombre de
&aacute; caballo,&rdquo; had volunteered to join the army, was
received into the ranks, and in a few weeks&rsquo; time rose to
be sergeant, for he could sign his name.</p>
<p>All being ready, and some men (one a young Frenchman born in
the place) being found with difficulty, the usual revolution
having drained off the able-bodied men, we made all ready for the
start.&nbsp; We bid good-bye to Don Guillermo, and to Don Tomas,
giving them as an addition to their library (which consisted of
some lives of saints and an odd volume of &ldquo;el culto al
Falo,&rdquo; which was in much request), our only book the
&ldquo;Feathered Arrow,&rdquo; either by Aimard or by Gerstaeker,
and mounting early in the morning after some trouble with the
wilder of our beasts, we took the road.</p>
<p>For the first few leagues Don Guillermo rode with us, and
then, after a smoke, bade us goodbye and rode away; his tall,
lithe figure dressed in loose black merino trousers tucked into
his boots, hat tied beneath his chin, and Pampa poncho, fading
out of sight, and by degrees the motion of his right arm touching
his horse up, Gaucho fashion, at every step, grew slower, then
stood still, and lastly vanished with the swaying figure of the
rider, out of sight.&nbsp; Upon what Pampa he now gallops is to
me unknown, or whether, where he is, <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>horses accompany him; but I would
fain believe it, for a heaven on foot would not be heaven to him;
but I still see him as he disappeared that day swaying to every
motion of his horse as they had been one flesh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Adios, Don Guillermo,&rdquo; or perhaps &ldquo;hasta
luego,&rdquo; you and your brother Don Tomas, your hospitable
shanty, and your three large cats, &ldquo;Yanish&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Yanquetruz,&rdquo; with one whose name I cannot now
recall, are with me often as I think on times gone by; and still
to-day (if it yet stands), upon the darkest night I could take
horse outside Durazno, cross the Yi, not by the
&ldquo;balsa,&rdquo; but at the ford below, and ride without a
word to any one straight to your house.</p>
<p>Days followed one another, and nights still caught us upon
horseback, driving or rounding up our horses, and nothing
interested us but that &ldquo;el Pangare&rdquo; was lame;
&ldquo;el Gargantillo&rdquo; looked a little thin, or that
&ldquo;el Zaino de la hacinda&rdquo; was missing in the morning
from the troop.&nbsp; Rivers we passed, the Paso de los Toros,
where the horses grouped together on a little beach of stones
refused to face the stream.&nbsp; Then sending out a yoke of oxen
to swim first, we pressed on them, and made them plunge, and kept
dead silence, whilst a naked man upon the other bank called to
them and whistled in a minor key; for horses swimming, so the
Gauchos say, see nothing, and head straight for a voice if it
calls soothingly.&nbsp; And whilst they swam, men in canoes lay
down the stream to stop them <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>drifting, and others swimming by
their side splashed water in their faces if they tried to
turn.&nbsp; The sun beat on the waste calling out the scent of
flowers; kingfishers fluttered on the water&rsquo;s edge, herons
stood motionless, great vultures circled overhead, and all went
well till, at the middle of the stream, a favourite grey roan
mare put up her head and snorted, beat the water with her feet,
and then sank slowly, standing quite upright as she
disappeared.</p>
<p>Mountains and plains we passed, and rivers fringed with thick,
hard thorny woods; we sweltered in the sun, sat shivering on our
horses during the watches of the night, slept fitfully by turns
at the camp fire, ate &ldquo;charqui&rdquo; and drank
mat&eacute;, and by degrees passing the Paso de los Novillos, San
Fructuoso, and the foot-hills of Haedo and the Cuchilla de
Peralta with its twin pulperias, we emerged on to the plain,
which, broken here and there by rivers, slopes toward the
southern frontier of Brazil.&nbsp; But as we had been
short-handed from the first, our &ldquo;caballada&rdquo; had got
into bad ways.&nbsp; A nothing startled them, and the malign
example of the group of wildlings brought from Braulio Islas, led
them astray, and once or twice they separated and gave us hours
of work to bring them back.&nbsp; Now as a
&ldquo;caballada&rdquo; which has once bolted is in the future
easily disposed to run, we gave strict orders no one was to get
off, though for a moment, without hobbling his horse.</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Camped
one cold morning on a river, not far from Brazil, and huddled
round a fire, cooking some sausages, flavoured with Chile pepper,
over a fire of leaves, one of our men who had been on horseback
watching all the night, drew near the fire, and getting off,
fastened his reins to a heavy-handled whip, and squatted on them,
as he tried to warm his hands.&nbsp; My horse, unsaddled, was
fastened by a lasso to a heavy stone, and luckily my partner and
the rest all had their horses well secured, for a
&ldquo;coati&rdquo; dived with a splash after a fish into the
river.&nbsp; In a moment the horses all took fright, and
separating, dashed to the open country with heads and tails
erect, snorting and kicking, and left us looking in despair,
whilst the horse with the whip fastened to the reins joined them,
and mine, tied to the stone, plunged furiously, but gave me time
to catch him, and mounting barebacked, for full five hours we
rode, and about nightfall brought the &ldquo;caballada&rdquo;
back to the camp, and driving them into an elbow of the river,
lighted great fires across the mouth of it, and went to sleep,
taking it conscientiously in turns to curse the man who let his
horse escape.</p>
<p>Five leagues or so upon the road the frontier lay, and here
the Brazilian Government had guards, but we being business men
smuggled our horses over in the night, led by a noted smuggler,
who took us by devious paths, through a thick wood, to a ford
known to him, only just practicable, and this we <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>passed
swimming and wading, and struggling through the mud.&nbsp; The
river wound about through beds of reeds, trees known as
&ldquo;sarandis&rdquo; grew thickly on the banks, and as we
passed &ldquo;carpinchos&rdquo; <a name="citation26"></a><a
href="#footnote26" class="citation">[26]</a> snorted; great fish
leaped into the air and fell with a resounding crash into the
stream, and in the trees was heard the scream of vultures, as
frightened by our passage they rose and weltered heavily through
the thick wood.&nbsp; By morning we were safe into Brazil,
passing a league or more through a thick cane-brake, where we
left several of our best horses, as to pursue them when they
straggled was impossible without running the risk of losing all
the rest.&nbsp; The crossing of the river had brought us to
another world.&nbsp; As at Carlisle and Gretna in the old days,
or as at Tuy and Valenza even to-day, the river had set a barrier
between the peoples as it had been ten miles instead of a few
hundred yards in width.&nbsp; Certainly, on the Banda Oriental,
especially in the department of Tacuaremb&ograve;, many
Brazilians had emigrated and settled there, but living amongst
the Gaucho population, in a measure they had been forced to
conform to the customs of the land.&nbsp; That is, they practised
hospitality after the Gaucho fashion, taking no money from the
wayfaring man for a piece of beef; they lent a horse, usually the
worst they had, if one came to their house with one&rsquo;s horse
tired; their women showed themselves</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>occasionally; and not being able to hold slaves, they
were obliged to adopt a different tone to men in general than
that they practised in the Empire of Brazil.&nbsp; But in the
time of which I write, in their own country they still carried
swords, slaves trotted after the rich
&ldquo;fazendero&rsquo;s&rdquo; horse, the women of the family
never sat down to table with the men, and if a stranger chanced
to call on business at their house, they were as jealously kept
from his eyes as they had all been Turks.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Fazenda&rdquo; houses had great iron-studded doors,
often a moat, and not infrequently a rusty cannon, though
generally dismounted, and a relic of bygone time.&nbsp; The
traveller fared, as a general rule, much worse than in the Banda
Oriental, for save at the large cattle-farms it was impossible to
buy a piece of meat.&nbsp; Admitted to the house, one rarely
passed beyond the guest-chamber, a room with four bare
white-washed walls; having for furniture a narrow hard-wood table
with wrought-iron supports between its legs; chairs cut
apparently out of the solid block, and a tin bucket or a large
gourd in the corner, with drinking-water; so that one&rsquo;s
sojourn at the place was generally brief, and one&rsquo;s
departure a relief to all concerned.&nbsp; Still on the frontier
the Gaucho influence made itself a little felt, and people were
not so inhospitable as they were further in the interior of the
land.&nbsp; Two or three leagues beyond the pass there was a
little town called &ldquo;Don Pedrito,&rdquo; towards which we
made; <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>but
a &ldquo;Pampero,&rdquo; whistling from the south, forced us to
camp upon a stream known as the &ldquo;Poncho Verde,&rdquo;
where, in the forties, Garibaldi was reported to have fought.</p>
<p>Wet to the skin and without food, we saw a fazenda not a mile
away, rode up to it, and for a wonder were asked inside, had
dinner in the guest-chamber, the owner sitting but not eating
with us; the black Brazilian beans and bacon carried in pompously
by three or four stalwart slaves, who puffed and sweated, trod on
each other&rsquo;s naked toes, and generally behaved as they had
been carrying sacks of corn aboard a ship, only that in this
instance no one stood in the gangway with a whip.&nbsp; Much did
the conversation run on politics; upon &ldquo;A Guerra dos
Farapos,&rdquo; which it appeared had riven the country in twain
what time our host was young.&nbsp; Farapo means a rag, and the
Republicans of fifty years ago in Rio Grande had adopted the
device after the fashion of &ldquo;Les gueux.&rdquo;&nbsp; Long
did they fight, and our host said: &ldquo;Praise to God,
infructuously,&rdquo; for how could men who wore moustaches and
full beards be compared to those who, like our host himself, wore
whiskers carefully trimmed in the style of those which at the
same epoch in our country were the trade-mark of the Iron
Duke?&nbsp; Elective kings, for so the old
&ldquo;conservador&rdquo; termed presidents, did not find favour
in his eyes; and in religion too the &ldquo;farapos&rdquo; were
seriously astray.&nbsp; They held the doctrine that all <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>creeds should
be allowed; which I once held myself, but now incline to the
belief that a religion and a name should be bestowed at baptism,
and that it should be constituted heresy of the worst kind, and
punishable by a fine, to change or palter with either the name or
the religion which our fathers have bestowed.</p>
<p>Politics over, we fell a-talking upon other lands; on Europe
and England, Portugal, and as to whether &ldquo;Rondon&rdquo; was
larger than Pelotas, or matters of that sort.&nbsp; Then our host
inquired if in &ldquo;Rondon&rdquo; we did not use &ldquo;la
bosa,&rdquo; and I not taking the thing up, he rose and
stretching out his hands, set them revolving like a saw, and I
then saw our supposed national pastime was what he meant; and
told him that it was practised, held in repute, and marked us out
as a people set apart; and that our greatness was largely founded
on the exercise he had endeavoured to depict.&nbsp; We bade
farewell, not having seen a woman, even a negress, about the
place; but as we left, a rustling at the door showed that the
snuff-and-butter-coloured sex had been observing us after the
fashion practised in Morocco and in houses in the East.&nbsp; The
hospitable &ldquo;conservador&rdquo; sent down a slave with a
great basket full of oranges; and seated at the camp we ate at
least three dozen, whilst the man waited patiently to take the
basket back.</p>
<p>Night caught us in the open &ldquo;camp,&rdquo; a south wind
blowing, and the drops congealing as they <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>fell.&nbsp;
Three of us muffled in ponchos rode round the horses, whilst the
others crouched at the fire, and midnight come, the riders rode
to the fire, and stretched on the wet mud slept fitfully, whilst
the others took their place.&nbsp; Day came at last; and
miserable we looked, wet, cold, and hungry, the fire black out,
matches all damp, and nothing else to do but march till the sun
rose and made life tolerable.&nbsp; Arrived at a small rancho we
got off, and found the owner was a Spaniard from Navarre, married
to a Brazilian woman.&nbsp; In mongrel Portuguese he bade us
welcome; said he was no Brazilian, and that his house was ours,
and hearing Spanish brightened up, and said in broken Spanish,
mixed with Portuguese, that he could never learn that language,
though he had passed a lifetime in the place.&nbsp; The country
pleased him, and though he had an orange garden of some three
acres in extent, though palms, mameyes and bananas grew around
his door, he mourned for chestnuts, which he remembered in his
youth, and said he recollected eating them whilst in Navarre, and
that they were better than all the fruit of all Brazil; thinking,
like Naaman, that Abana and Pharpar were better than all the
waters of Israel, or rivers of Damascus; or perhaps moved in some
mysterious way by the remembrance of the chestnut forests, the
old grey stone-roofed houses, and the wind whistling through the
pine woods of some wild valley of Navarre.&nbsp; At the old
Spaniard&rsquo;s house a difficulty cropped up with our <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>men.&nbsp; I
having told a man to catch a horse which looked a little wild, he
answered he was not a horse-breaker, and I might ride the beast
myself.&nbsp; I promptly did so, and asked him if he knew what a
wild horse was, and if it was not true that horses which could be
saddled without tying their hind legs were tame, and the rest
laughing at him, he drew his knife, and running at me, found
himself looking down the barrel of a pistol which my partner with
some forethought had produced.&nbsp; This brought things to a
crisis, and they all left us, with a hundred horses on our
hands.&nbsp; Several Brazilians having volunteered, we took them,
bought a tame horse accustomed to carry packs, procured a
bullock, had it killed, and the meat &ldquo;jerked&rdquo;; and
making bags out of the hide, filled them with food, for, as the
Spaniard said, &ldquo;in the country you intend to cross you
might as well be amongst Moors, for even money will not serve to
get a piece of beef.&rdquo;&nbsp; A kindly soul the Spaniard, his
name has long escaped me, still he was interesting as but the
truly ignorant can ever be.&nbsp; The world to him was a great
mystery, as it is even to those who know much more than he; but
all the little landmarks of the narrow boundaries of his life he
had by heart; and they sufficed him, as the great world itself
cannot suffice those who, by living in its current, see its
muddiness.</p>
<p>So one day told another, and each night found us on horseback
riding round the drove.&nbsp; Through <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>forest, over baking plain, up
mountain paths, through marshes, splashing to the saddle-flaps,
by lone &ldquo;fazendas,&rdquo; and again through herds of cattle
dotting the plain for miles, we took our way.&nbsp; Little straw
huts, each with a horse tied day and night before them, were our
fairway marks.&nbsp; Day followed night without adventure but
when a horse suddenly threw its rider and a Brazilian peon
uncoiled his lasso, and with a jangling of spurs against the
stirrups, sprang into life, and in a moment the long snaky rope
flew through the air and settled round the runaway just
underneath his ears.&nbsp; Once in a clearing, as we plodded on,
climbing the last barrier of the mountain range, to emerge upon
the district called &ldquo;Encima de la Sierra,&rdquo; a deer
appeared jumping into the air, and coming down again on the same
spot repeatedly, the Brazilians said that it was fighting with a
snake, for &ldquo;God has given such instinct to those beasts
that they attack and kill all snakes, knowing that they are
enemies of man.&rdquo; <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a>&nbsp; A scheme of
the creation which, if held in its entirety, shows curious
lacun&aelig; in the Creator&rsquo;s mind, only to be bridged over
by that faith which in itself makes all men equal, that is, of
course, when they experience it and recognize its charm.&nbsp; So
on a day we crossed the hills, rode through a wood, and came out
on a plain at the far end of which a little town appeared.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>For
about ten leagues in circumference the plain stretched out,
walled in with woods, which here and there jutted out into it,
forming islands and peninsulas.&nbsp; The flat-roofed town
straggled along three flat and sandy streets; the little plaza,
planted with mameyes and paraiso trees, served as a
lounging-place by day, by night a caravanserai for negroes; in
time of rain the streets were turned to streams, and poured their
water into the plaza, which became a lake.&nbsp; At the west
corner of the square was situated Cardozo&rsquo;s store, the
chief emporium, mart, and meeting-place (after the barber&rsquo;s
and the chemist&rsquo;s) of the whole town.&nbsp; Two languid and
yellow, hermaphroditic young Brazilians dressed in alpaca coats,
white trousers, and patent leather boots dispensed the wares,
whilst negroes ran about rolling in casks of flour, hogsheads of
sugar, and bales of black tobacco from Bahia, or from
Maranh&atilde;o.&nbsp; Such exterior graces did the little town
of the High Cross exhibit to us, wearied with the baking days and
freezing nights of the last month&rsquo;s campaign.&nbsp; Whether
some Jesuit in the days gone by, when missionaries stood up
before their catechumens unsustained by Gatling guns, sheltered
but by a rude cross in their hands and their meek lives, had
named the place, in commemoration of some saving act of grace
done by Jehovah in the conversion of the heathen, none can
tell.&nbsp; It may be that the Rood set up on high was but a
landmark, or again to mark a <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>frontier line against the heathen to
the north, or yet it may have been the grave of some Paulista,
who in his foray against the Jesuits in Paraguay died here on his
return, whilst driving on before him a herd of converts to become
slaves in far San Paulo, to the greater glory of the Lord.&nbsp;
All these things may have been, or none of them; but the quiet
sleepy place, the forests with their parrots and macaws, their
herds of peccaries, their bands of screaming monkeys, the
bright-striped tiger-cats, the armadillos, coatis,
capibar&aacute;s, and gorgeous flaming &ldquo;seibos,&rdquo; all
intertwined by ropes of living cordage of lianas, and the supreme
content of all the dwellers in the district, with God,
themselves, their country, and their lives, still after twenty
years is fresh, and stirs me, as the memory of the Pacific stirs
a reclaimed &ldquo;beach-comber&rdquo; over his grog, and makes
him say, &ldquo;I never should have left them islands, for a man
was happy in &rsquo;em, living on the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this commercial centre (centro do commercio) we were
advised to go, and there I rode, leaving my partner with the
peons riding round the caballada upon the plains.&nbsp; Dressed
as I was in the clothes worn by the Gauchos of the Banda
Oriental, a hat tied underneath the chin with a black cord, a
vicu&ntilde;a poncho, and armed with large resounding silver
spurs, I made a blot of colour in Cardozo&rsquo;s shop amongst
the quietly dressed Brazilians, who, though they were some of the
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>smartest
men in South America upon a horse, were always clad in
sober-coloured raiment, wore ordinary store-cut trousers, and had
their feet endued with all the graces of a five-dollar
elastic-sided boot.</p>
<p>Half-an-hour&rsquo;s talk with the chief partner shattered all
our plans.&nbsp; It then appeared that to take horses on to Rio
was impossible, the country, after San Paulo, being one dense
forest, and even if the horses stood the change of climate, the
trip would take a year, thus running off with any profit which we
might expect.&nbsp; Moreover, it appeared that mules were in
demand throughout Brazil, but horses, till past San Paulo, five
hundred miles ahead, but little valued, and almost as cheap,
though much inferior in breed to those bred on the plains of
Uruguay.&nbsp; He further told us to lose not a day in teaching
all the horses to eat salt, for without that they would not live
a month, as once the range of mountains passed between Cruz Alta
and the plains, no horse or mule could live without its three
months&rsquo; ration of rock-salt; there being in the pasture
some malign quality which salt alone could cure.&nbsp; Naturally
he had the cheapest salt in the whole town, and as our horses
were by this time so thin that it was quite impossible to take
them further without rest, they having been a month upon the
road, we set about to find an enclosed pasture where we could let
them feed.</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Xavier
Fernandez, a retired slave- and mule-dealer, was the man on whom
by accident we fell.&nbsp; Riding about the plain disconsolately,
like Arabs changing their pastures, and with our horses feeding
near a little pond, we met him.&nbsp; An old straw hat,
bed-ticking trousers, and with his naked feet shoved into
slippers of carpindo leather, and an iron spur attached to one of
them and hanging down at least an inch below his heel, mounted
upon a mule saddled with the iron-framed Brazilian saddle, with
the addition of a crupper, a thing strange to our eyes,
accustomed to the wild horses of the plains, he did not look the
type of &ldquo;landed gentleman,&rdquo; but such he was, owner of
flocks and herds, and, in particular, of a well-fenced pasture,
enclosing about two leagues of land.</p>
<p>After much talk of things in general, of politics, and of the
revolution in progress in the republic we had left, upon our
folly in bringing horses, which could go no further into the
interior, and of the money we should have made had we brought
&ldquo;bestas,&rdquo; that is, mules, we agreed to pay him so
much a month for the use of his fenced pasture, and for our
maintenance during the time we stayed.&nbsp; Leaving the horses
feeding, watched by the men, we rode to see the place.&nbsp; Upon
the way Xavier imparted much of history, a good deal of his lore,
and curious local information about Cruz Alta, duly distorted, as
befits a reputable man, through the <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>perspective of his predilections,
politics, faith, opinions, and general view of life.</p>
<p>We learned that once Cruz Alta was a most important place,
that six-and-thirty thousand mules used to be wintered there, and
then in spring moved on to the great fair at Surucuba in the
Sert&atilde;o, that is the forest district of San Paulo, and then
sold to the merchants from the upper districts of Brazil.&nbsp;
But of late years the number had been much reduced, and then
stood at about twelve thousand.&nbsp; This he set down to the
accursed steamboats which took them up the coast, to the
continual fighting in the state of Uruguay, and generally to the
degeneration which he thought he saw in man.&nbsp; In the heyday
of the prosperity of the place &ldquo;gold flowed from every
hand,&rdquo; so much so, that even &ldquo;as mulheres da
vida&rdquo; kept their accounts in ounces; but now money was
scarce, and business done in general by barter, coin being hardly
even seen except for mules, for which it was imperative, as no
one parted with &ldquo;bestas&rdquo; except for money down.&nbsp;
Passing a little wood we saw a row of stakes driven into the
ground, and he informed us that they were evidently left by some
Birivas, that is people from San Paulo, after having used them to
secure their mules whilst saddling.&nbsp; The Paulistas, we then
learned, used the &ldquo;sirigote,&rdquo; that is, the
old-fashioned high-peaked saddle brought from Portugal in times
gone by, and not the &ldquo;recado,&rdquo; the saddle of the
Gauchos, which is flat, and suited <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>better for galloping upon a plain
than for long marches over mountain passes and through
woods.&nbsp; All the points, qualities, with the shortcomings and
the failings of a mule, he did rehearse.&nbsp; It then appeared a
mule should be mouse-coloured, for the red-coloured mule is of no
use, the grey soft-footed, and the black bad-tempered, the
piebald fit &ldquo;for a German,&rdquo; which kind of folk he
held in abhorrence mixed with contempt, saying they whined in
speaking as it had been the whining of an armadillo or a
sloth.&nbsp; The perfect mule should be large-headed, not with a
little-hammer head like to a horse, but long and thin, with ears
erect, round feet, and upon no account when spurred ought it to
whisk its tail, for that was most unseemly, fit but for Germans,
Negroes, Indians, and generally for all those he counted
senseless people&mdash;&ldquo;gente sem raz&atilde;o&rdquo;;
saying &ldquo;of course all men are of one flesh, but some are
dog&rsquo;s flesh, and let them ride mules who whisk about their
tails like cattle in a marsh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Beguiled by these, and
other stories, we soon reached the gate of the enclosure, and he,
dismounting, drew a key from one of the pockets of his belt and
let us in.&nbsp; A short half-hour brought us up to his house,
passing through ground all overgrown with miamia and other shrubs
which did not promise to afford much pasturage; but he informed
us that we must not expect the grasses of the plains up at Cruz
Alta, and thus conversing we arrived before his house.</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>Surrounded by a fence enclosing about an acre, the house
stood just on the edge of a thick wood.&nbsp; On one side were
the corrals for horses and for cattle, and on the other the
quarters of the slaves.&nbsp; In shape the houses resembled a
flattish haystack thatched with reeds, and with a verandah rising
round it, supported on strong posts.&nbsp; At either end a kind
of baldachino, one used as a stable and the other as a kitchen,
and in the latter a fire continually alight, and squatted by it
night and day a negress, either baking flat, thin girdle-cakes
made of maize, shaking the flour out of her hand upon an iron
plate, or else filling a gourd of mat&eacute; with hot water, and
running to and fro into the house to give it to her mistress,
never apparently thinking it worth while to take the kettle with
her into the house.</p>
<p>The family, not quite so white as Xavier himself, consisted of
a mother always in slippers, dressed in a skirt and shift, which
latter garment always seemed about to fall down to her waist, and
two thin, large-eyed, yellowish girls arrayed in vestments like a
pillow-case, with a string fastening them at the narrowest
place.&nbsp; Slave girls of several hues did nothing and
chattered volubly, and their mistress had to stand over them, a
slipper in her hand, when maize was pounded in a rough mortar
hewn from a solid log, in which the slaves hammered with pestles,
one down, the other up, after the fashion of blacksmiths making a
horsehoe, but with <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>groans, and making believe to be extenuated after three
minutes&rsquo; work, and stopping instantly the moment that their
mistress went into the house to light her cigarette.</p>
<p>An official in Cruz Alta, known as the Capit&atilde;o do
Matto, holding a status between a gamekeeper and a parish clerk,
kept by the virtue of his office a whipping-house, to which
recalcitrant or idle slaves were theoretically sent; but in the
house of Xavier at least no one took interest enough in anything,
except Xavier himself, to take the trouble; and the slaves ruled
the female part of the establishment, if not exactly with a rod
of iron, still to their perfect satisfaction, cooking and sewing
now and then; sweeping, but fitfully; and washing when they
wanted to look smart and figure at a dance.&nbsp; The
Capit&atilde;o do Matto was supposed to bring back runaways and
keep a leash of bloodhounds, but in the memory of man no one had
seen him sally forth, and for the blood-hounds, they were long
dead, although he drew regular rations for their
maintenance.&nbsp; In the interior of Brazil his office was no
sinecure, but in Cruz Alta horses were plentiful, the country
relatively easy, and slaves who ran away, which happened seldom,
timed their escape so as to put a good day&rsquo;s journey
between them and any possible pursuit, and on the evening of the
fifth day, if all went well, they got across the frontier into
Uruguay.</p>
<p>Terms once arranged, we let our horses loose, <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>laid out
rock-salt in lumps, first catching several of the tamest horses,
and forcing pieces into their mouths; they taught the others, and
we had nothing more to do.&nbsp; We paid our peons off, got our
clothes washed, rested, and then found time at first hang heavy
on our hands.&nbsp; Hearing an Englishman lived about ten leagues
off, we saddled up and rode to visit him.&nbsp; After losing
ourselves in a thick forest of some kind of pine, we reached his
house, but the <i>soi-disant</i> Briton was from Amsterdam, could
speak no English, was a little drunk, but asked us to get off and
dine with him.&nbsp; During the dinner, which we had all alone,
his wife and daughter standing looking at us (he too drunk to
eat), pigs ran into the room, a half-grown tapir lay in a corner,
and two new-caught macaws screamed horribly, so that, the banquet
over, we did not stay, but thanked him in Portuguese, which he
spoke badly, and rode off home, determining to sleep at the first
wood, rather than face a night in such a place.</p>
<p>The evening caught us near to a forest, the trail, sandy and
white, running close to a sort of cove formed in the trees, and
here we camped, taking our saddles off, lighting a fire, and
lying down to sleep just in the opening of the cove, our horses
tied inside.&nbsp; All through the night people appeared to pass
along the road.&nbsp; I lay awake half-dozing now and then, and
watched the bats, looked at the fire-flies flitting about the
trees, heard the <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>harsh howling of the monkeys, the tapirs stamp, the
splash made by the lobos and carpinchos as they dashed into the
stream, and then slept soundly, and awoke to find one of the
horses gone.&nbsp; The moon shone brightly, and, waking up my
friend, I told him of our loss.&nbsp; We knew the horse must have
a rope attached to him, and that he probably would try to get
back to Cruz Alta, along the road we came.&nbsp; My horse was
difficult to bit, but by the aid of tying up one foot, and
covering his eyes up with a handkerchief, we bitted him, then
mounted both of us upon his back, hiding the other saddle behind
some grass, and started on the road.&nbsp; The sandy trail was
full of horses&rsquo; tracks, so that we could do nothing but
ride on, hoping to catch him feeding by the way.&nbsp; About a
league we rode, and then, not seeing him, turned slowly back to
get the other saddle, make some coffee, and start home when it
was light.&nbsp; To our astonishment, upon arriving at the cove,
the other horse was there, and neighing wildly, straining on his
rope, and it appeared that he had never gone, but being tied
close to the wood had wandered in, and we, thinking he must have
gone, being half-dazed with sleep, had never thought of looking
at his rope.</p>
<p>Defrauded, so to speak, out of our Englishman, and finding
that the horses, after the long journey and the change of water
and of grass, daily grew thinner, making it quite impossible to
move them, forwards or back, and after having vainly tried to <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>sell them,
change them for mules, or sugar, quite without success, no one
except some &ldquo;fazendero&rdquo; here and there caring for
horses in a land where every one rode mules, we settled down to
loaf.&nbsp; Once certain we had lost our money and our pains,
nothing remained but to wait patiently until the horses got into
sufficient state to sell, for all assured us that every day we
went further into the interior, they would lose flesh, that we
should have them bitten by snakes in the forests, and arrive at
Rio, if we ever got there, either on foot, or with but the horses
which we rode.</p>
<p>For a short time we had almost determined to push on, even if
we arrived at Rio with but a horse apiece.&nbsp; Then came
reflection, that reflection which has dressed the world in drab,
made cowards of so many heroes, lost so many generous impulses,
spoiled so many poems, and which mankind has therefore made a god
of, and we decided to remain.&nbsp; Then did Cruz Alta put on a
new look.&nbsp; We saw the wondrous vegetation of the woods, felt
the full charm of the old-world quiet life, watched the strange
multi-coloured insects, lay by the streams to mark the birds,
listened for the howlings of the monkeys when night fell; picked
the strange flowers, admired the butterflies floating like little
blue and yellow albatrosses, their wings opened and poised in the
still air, or wondered when a topaz-coloured humming-bird, a red
macaw, an orange-and-black toucan, or a red-crested cardinal
flitted across our path.&nbsp; <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Inside the wood behind the house were
clearings, made partly by the axe and partly by fire, amongst the
tall morosimos, coronillos, and palo santos, and in the clearings
known as &ldquo;ro&ccedil;as&rdquo; grew beans and maize, with
mandioca and occasionally barley, and round them ran a prickly
hedge either of cactuses or thorny bush, cut down to keep out
tapirs and deer, and usually in a straw hut a negro lay, armed
with a flint-lock gun to fire at parrots, scare off monkeys, and
generally to act as guardian of the place.&nbsp; Orange and lemon
trees, with citrons and sweet limes, grew plentifully, and had
run wild amongst the woods; bananas were planted in the
ro&ccedil;a; but what we liked the best was a wild fruit called
Guavirami, which grew in patches on the open camp, yellow and
round, about the size of a small plum, low-growing, having three
or four small stones, cold as an icicle to taste upon the hottest
day.&nbsp; A little river ran through the middle of the wood, and
in a stream a curious machine was placed for pounding maize,
driven by water-power, and unlike any contrivance of a similar
nature I had ever seen before.&nbsp; An upright block of wood,
burned from the centre of a tree, stood in the stream, hollowed
out in the centre to contain the maize; water ran up a little
channel, and released a pestle, which fell with a heavy thud upon
the corn, with the result that if one left a basket full in the
great mortar over-night, by morning it was pounded, saving that
labour which God Himself seems to have thought not so <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>ennobling
after all, as He first instituted it to carry out a curse.</p>
<p>So one day told, and may, for all I know, have certified
another, but we recked little of them, riding into Cruz Alta now
and then and eating cakes at the confectioner&rsquo;s, drinking
innumerable glasses of sweet Malaga, laying in stores of
cigarettes, frequenting all the dances far and near, joining in
cattle-markings, races, and anything in short which happened in
the place.</p>
<p>Perhaps our greatest friend was one Luis, a slave, born in
Angola, brought over quite &ldquo;Bozal&rdquo; (or muzzled, as
the Brazilians say of negroes who can speak no Portuguese), then
by degrees became &ldquo;ladino,&rdquo; was baptized, bought by
our host Xavier, and had remained with him all the remainder of
his life.&nbsp; Black, and not comely in the least, bowlegged
from constant riding, nose flat, and ears like flappers, a row of
teeth almost as strong as a young shark&rsquo;s, flat feet, and
crisp Angola wool which grew so thickly on his head that had you
thrown a pin on it, it could not have reached the skin, he yet
was honest and faithful to the verge of folly; but then, if
heaven there be, it can be but inhabited by fools, for wise men,
prudent folk, and those who thrive, have their reward like
singers, quickly, and can look for nothing more.&nbsp; He spoke
about himself half-pityingly under the style of &ldquo;Luis o
Captivo,&rdquo; was pious, fervent in sacred song, instant in
prayer (especially if work was to be done), not <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>idle either,
superstitious and affectionate with all the virtues of the most
excellent Saint Bernard or Newfoundland dog, and with but little
of the imperfections of a man except the power of speech.&nbsp;
Often he had been with his master into Uruguay to purchase
cattle, or to buy mules for the Brazilian market, and when I
asked him if he did not know that he was free the instant that he
stepped in Uruguay, said: &ldquo;Yes, but here I was brought up
when I first came from Africa; they have been kind to me, it is
to me as the querencia <a name="citation46"></a><a
href="#footnote46" class="citation">[46]</a> is to a horse, and
were it not for that, small fear I should return, to remain here
&lsquo;feito captivo&rsquo;; but then I love the place, and, as
you know, &lsquo;the mangy calf lived all the winter, and then
died in the spring.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He held the Christian
faith in its entirety, doubting no dogma, being pleased with
every saint, but yet still hankered after fetish, which he
remembered as a child, and seemed to think not incompatible with
Christianity, as rendering it more animistic and familiar,
smoothing away its angularities, blotting whatever share of
reason it may have away, and, above all, giving more scope, if
possible, to faith, and thereby opening a larger field of
possibilities to the believer&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>So Luis with others of his kind, as Jango, Jico, and Manduco,
became our friends, looking upon us with that respect mixed with
contempt which is the attitude of those who see that you possess
the <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>mysterious arts of reading and of writing, but cannot
see a horse&rsquo;s footprint on hard ground; or if you lose
yourself, have to avail yourself of what Luis referred to as
&ldquo;the one-handed watch the sailors use, which points the way
to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much did Xavier talk of the Indians of the woods, the
&ldquo;Bugres,&rdquo; as the Brazilians call them; about the
&ldquo;Botocudos,&rdquo; who wear a plug stuck in their lower
lip, and shape their ears with heavy weights in youth, so that
they hang upon their shoulders; and much about those
&ldquo;Infidel&rdquo; who through a blowpipe direct a little
arrow at the travelling &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; in the woods,
whose smallest touch is death.&nbsp; It then appeared his father
(fica agora na gloria) was a patriot, that is, &rsquo;twas he who
extirpated the last of all the &ldquo;Infidel&rdquo; from the
forests where they lived.&nbsp; Most graphically did he tell how
the last Indians were hunted down with dogs, and in a pantomime
he showed how they jumped up and fell when they received the
shot, and putting out his tongue and writhing hideously, he
imitated how they wriggled on the ground, explaining that they
were worse to kill than is a tapir, and put his father and the
other patriots to much unnecessary pain.&nbsp; And as he talked,
the woods, the fields, the river and the plain bathed in the sun,
which unlike that of Africa does not seem weary of its task, but
shines unwearied, looking as it does on a new world and life,
shimmered and blazed, great lizards drank its rays flattening <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>themselves
upon the stones in ecstasy, humming-birds quivered at the heart
of every flower; above the stream the dragon-flies hung poised;
only some &ldquo;Infidel&rdquo; whom the patriots had destroyed
seemed wanting, and the landscape looked incomplete without a
knot of them in their high feather crowns stealthily stealing
round a corner of the woods.</p>
<p>In the uncomprehended future, incomprehensible and strange,
and harder far to guess at than the remotest semi-comprehended
past, surely the Spanish travellers and their writings will have
a value quite apart from that of any other books.&nbsp; For then
the world will hold no &ldquo;Bugres&rdquo;; not a
&ldquo;Botocudo&rdquo; will be left, and those few Indian and
Negro tribes who yet persist will be but mere travesties of the
whites: their customs lost, their lore, such as it was, despised;
and we have proved ourselves wiser than the Creator, who wasted
so much time creating beings whom we judged unfit to live, and
then, in mercy to ourselves and Him, destroyed, so that no
evidence of His miscalculated plan should last to shame Him when
He thought of His mistake.&nbsp; So to this end (unknowingly) the
missionary works, and all the Jesuits, those who from Paraguay
through the Chiquitos, and across the Uruguay, in the dark Moxos,
and in the forests of the Andes, gave their lives to bring as
they thought life everlasting to the Indians&mdash;all were
fools.&nbsp; Better by far instead of Bibles, lives of saints,
water of <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>baptism, crucifixes, and all the tackle of their trade,
that they had brought swords, lances, and a good cross-bow each,
and gone to work in the true scientific way, and recognized that
the right way with savages is to preach heaven to them and then
despatch them to it, for it is barbarous to keep them standing
waiting as it were, just at the portals of eternal bliss.</p>
<p>And as we lingered at Cruz Alta, Christmas drew near, and all
the people began to make &ldquo;pesebres,&rdquo; with ox and ass,
the three wise men, the star of Bethlehem, the Redeemer (not of
the Botocudos and the Bugres) swaddled and laid in straw.&nbsp;
Herdsmen and negroes dismounted at the door, fastened their
half-wild mules or horses carefully to posts, removed their hats,
drawing them down over their faces furtively, and then walked in
on tiptoe, their heavy iron spurs clanking upon the ground, to
see the Wondrous Child.&nbsp; They lounged about the room,
speaking in whispers as he might awake, and then departed
silently, murmuring that it was &ldquo;fermosisimo,&rdquo; and
getting on their horses noiselessly were gone, and in a minute
disappeared upon the plain.&nbsp; Then came the Novena with
prayer and carols, the prayers read by Xavier himself out of a
tattered book, all the assembled family joining with unction in
the responses, and beating on their breasts.&nbsp; Luis and all
the slaves joined in the carols lustily, especially in one sung
in a minor key long-drawn-out as a <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>sailor&rsquo;s shanty, or a
forebitter sung in a calm whilst waiting for a breeze.&nbsp;
After each verse there was a kind of chorus calling upon the
sinner to repent, bidding him have no fear but still hold on, and
thus exhorting him&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Chegai, Chegai, pecador, &aacute;o pe da
cruz<br />
Fica nosso Senhor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christmas Day found us all at mass in the little church,
horses and mules being tied outside the door to the trees in the
plaza, and some left hobbled, and all waiting as if St. Hubert
was about to issue forth and bless them.</p>
<p>Painfully and long, the preacher dwelt upon the glorious day,
the country people listening as it were new to them, and as if
all the events had happened on the plain hard by.&nbsp; In the
evening rockets announced the joyful news, and the stars shone
out over the woods and plains as on the evening when the bright
particular star guided the three sheikhs to some such place as
was the rancho of our host.</p>
<p>Christmas rejoicings over, a month sped past and found us
still, so to speak, wind-bound in the little town.&nbsp; No one
would buy our horses, some of which died bitten by snakes.&nbsp;
It was impossible to think of going on, and to return equally
difficult, so that there seemed a probability of being obliged to
pass a lifetime in the place.&nbsp; People began to look at us
half in a kindly, half <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>contemptuous way, as people look in
general upon those who fail, especially when they themselves have
never tried to do anything at all but live, and having done it
with considerable success look upon failure as a sort of minor
crime, to be atoned for by humility, and to be reprobated after
the fashion of adultery, with a half-deprecating laugh.&nbsp;
Sometimes we borrowed ancient flint-lock guns and lay in wait for
tapirs, but never saw them, as in the thick woods they move as
silently as moles in sand, and leave as little trace.&nbsp; Luis
told of how, mounted on a half-wild horse, he had long ago
lassoed a tapir, and found himself and horse dragged slowly and
invincibly towards a stream, the horse resisting terrified, the
&ldquo;gran besta&rdquo; <a name="citation51"></a><a
href="#footnote51" class="citation">[51]</a> apparently quite
cool, so that at last he had to cut his lasso and escape from
what he called the greatest peril of his life; he thought he was
preserved partly by the interposition of the saints and partly by
a &ldquo;feti&ccedil;o&rdquo; which, in defiance of religion, he
luckily had hanging round his neck.</p>
<p>Just when all hope was gone, and we thought seriously of
leaving the horses to their fate, and pushing on with some of the
best of them towards Rio, a man appeared upon the scene, and
offered to buy them, half for money and half &ldquo;a
troco,&rdquo; that is barter, for it appeared he was a pawnbroker
and had a house full of silver horse-gear, which <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>had never
been redeemed.&nbsp; After much bargaining we closed for three
hundred dollars and a lot of silver bridles, spurs, whips, and
other stuff, after reserving four of the best horses for
ourselves to make our journey back.&nbsp; At the head of so much
capital our spirits rose, and we determined to push on to
Paraguay, crossing the Uruguay and Parana, ride through the
Misiones, and at Asuncion, where I had friends, take ship;
<i>aguas abajo</i>, for the River Plate.&nbsp; We paid our debts
and bid good-bye to Xavier, his wife and sallow daughters, and to
all the slaves; gave Luis a silver-mounted whip, bought some
provisions, put on our silver spurs, bridles, and as much as
possible of the silver gear we had become possessed of, and at
daybreak, mounted upon a cream-and-white piebald, the &ldquo;Bayo
Overo,&rdquo; and a red bay known as the &ldquo;Pateador,&rdquo;
leading a horse apiece, we passed out of Xavier&rsquo;s
&ldquo;potrero,&rdquo; <a name="citation52"></a><a
href="#footnote52" class="citation">[52]</a> and started on the
road.</p>
<p>During the last few days at Xavier&rsquo;s we had taught the
horses we intended to take to Paraguay to eat Indian corn,
fastening them up without any other food all day, and putting
salt into their mouths.&nbsp; The art once learnt, we had to
stand beside them whilst they ate, to keep off chickens and pigs
who drove them from their food, the horses being too stupid to
help themselves.&nbsp; If I remember rightly, their ration was
eight cobs, which we husked for them in our hands, blistering <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>our fingers
in the process as they had been burned.&nbsp; But now the trouble
of the process was repaid, the horses going strongly all day
long.&nbsp; We passed out of the little plain, skirted a
pine-wood, rode up a little hill, and saw the country stretching
towards the Uruguay, a park-like prairie interspersed with
trees.&nbsp; Cruz Alta, a white patch shining against the
green-grey plain encircled with its woods, was just in sight, the
church-tower standing like a needle in the clear air against the
sky.&nbsp; Half a league more and it dropped out of view, closing
the door upon a sort of half B&oelig;otian Arcady, but remaining
still a memory after twenty years, with all the little incidents
of the three months&rsquo; sojourn in the place fresh, and yet
seeming as they had happened not to myself, but to a person I had
met, and who had told the tale.</p>
<p>By easy stages we journeyed on, descending gradually towards
the Uruguay, passing through country almost unpopulated, so large
were the &ldquo;fazendas,&rdquo; and so little stocked.&nbsp; In
the last century the Jesuits had here collected many tribes of
Indians, and their history, is it not told in the pages of
Montoya Lozano, Padre Guevara, and the other chroniclers of the
doings of the &ldquo;Company,&rdquo; and to be read in the
Archivo de Simancas, in that of Seville, and the uncatalogued
&ldquo;legajos&rdquo; of the national library at Madrid?&nbsp;
Throughout the country that we passed through, the fierce
Paulistas had raided in times gone by, carrying off the <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Christian
Indians to be slaves.&nbsp; The Portuguese and Spaniards had
often fought&mdash;witness the names &ldquo;O matto <a
name="citation54a"></a><a href="#footnote54a"
class="citation">[54a]</a> Portogues, O matto Castelhano,&rdquo;
and the like, showing where armies had manoeuvred, whilst the
poor Indians waited like sheep, rejoicing when the butchers
turned the knife at one another&rsquo;s throats.&nbsp; To-day all
trace of Jesuits and Missions have long disappeared, save for a
ruined church or two, and here and there a grassy mound called in
the language of the country a &ldquo;tapera,&rdquo; <a
name="citation54b"></a><a href="#footnote54b"
class="citation">[54b]</a> showing where a settlement had
stood.</p>
<p>We camped at lonely ranchos inhabited, in general, by free
negroes, or by the side of woods, choosing, if possible, some
little cove in the wood, in which we tied the horses, building a
fire in the mouth, laid down and slept, after concocting a vile
beverage bought in Cruz Alta under the name of tea, but made I
think of birch-leaves, and moistening pieces of the hard jerked
beef in orange-juice to make it palatable.</p>
<p>So after five or six days of steady travelling, meeting, if I
remember rightly, not a living soul upon the way, except a Gaucho
from the Banda Oriental, who one night came to our fire, and
seeing the horrible brew of tea in a tin-pot asked <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>for a little
of the &ldquo;black water,&rdquo; not knowing what it was, we
reached the Uruguay.&nbsp; The river, nearly half-a-mile in
breadth, flowed sluggishly between primeval woods, great
alligators basked with their backs awash, flamingoes fished among
the shallow pools, herons and cranes sat on dead stumps, vultures
innumerable perched on trees, and in the purple bunches of the
&ldquo;seibos&rdquo; humming-birds seemed to nestle, so rapid was
their flight, and over all a darkish vapour hung, blending the
trees and water into one, and making the &ldquo;balsa,&rdquo; as
it laboured over after repeated calls, look like the barque of
Styx.&nbsp; Upon the other side lay Corrientes, once a vast
mission territory, but to-day, in the narrow upper portion that
we traversed, almost a desert, that is a desert of tall grass
with islands of timber dotted here and there, and an occasional
band of ostriches scudding across the plain.</p>
<p>Camped by a wood about a quarter of a league from a lonely
rancho, we were astonished, just at even-fall, by the arrival of
the owner of the house mounted upon a half-wild horse, a spear in
his hand, escorted by his two ragged sons mounted on half-wild
ponies, and holding in their hands long canes to which a broken
sheep-shear had been fixed.&nbsp; The object of his visit, as he
said, was to inquire if we had seen a tiger which had killed some
sheep, but his suspicious glance made me think he thought we had
designs upon his cattle, and he had come <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>to
reconnoitre us; but our offer of some of the Cruz Alta tea soon
made us friends, and after drinking almost a quart of it, he said
&ldquo;Muy rico,&rdquo; and rode back to his house.</p>
<p>The third day&rsquo;s riding brought us to the little town of
Candelaria, built on a high bank over the Parana.&nbsp; Founded
on Candlemas Day in 1665, it was the chief town of the Jesuit
missions.&nbsp; Here, usually, the &ldquo;Provincial&rdquo; <a
name="citation56a"></a><a href="#footnote56a"
class="citation">[56a]</a> resided, and here the political
business of their enormous territory was done.&nbsp; Stretching
almost from Cruz Alta to within fifty leagues of Asuncion del
Paraguay, and from Yapey&uacute; upon the Uruguay almost to the
&ldquo;Salto de Guayra&rdquo; upon the Parana, the territory
embraced an area larger than many a kingdom, and was administered
without an army, solely by about two hundred priests.&nbsp; The
best proof of the success of their administration is that in
these days the Indians, now to be numbered by a few thousand,
were estimated at about two hundred thousand, and peopled all the
country now left desolate, or which at least was desolate at the
time of which I write.&nbsp; Even Azara, <a
name="citation56b"></a><a href="#footnote56b"
class="citation">[56b]</a> a bitter opponent of their system,
writes of the Jesuit rule&mdash;&ldquo;Although the Fathers had
supreme command, they used their power with a gentleness and
moderation which one cannot but admire.&rdquo; <a
name="citation56c"></a><a href="#footnote56c"
class="citation">[56c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>I leave
to the economists, with all the reverend rabble rout of
politicians, statistic-mongers and philanthropists, whether or
not two hundred thousand living Indians were an asset in the
world&rsquo;s property; and to the pious I put this question, If,
as I suppose, these men had souls just as immortal as our own,
might it not have been better to preserve their bodies, those
earthly envelopes without which no soul can live, rather than by
exposing them to all those influences which the Jesuits dreaded,
to kill them off, and leave their country without population for
a hundred years?</p>
<p>But at the time of which I write neither my partner nor I
cared much for speculations of that kind, but were more occupied
with the condition of our horses, for, by that time, the
&ldquo;Bayo Overo&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Pateador&rdquo; were
become part and parcel of ourselves, and we thought more about
their welfare than that of all the Indians upon earth.</p>
<p>La Candelaria, at the time when we passed through, was fallen
from its proud estate, and had become a little Gaucho country
town with sandy streets and horses tied at every door&mdash;a
barren sun-burnt plaza, with a few Japanese ash-trees and
Paraisos; the &ldquo;Commandancia&rdquo; with the Argentine <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>blue-and-white barred flag, and trade-mark rising sun,
hanging down listlessly against the post, and for all remnants of
the Jesuit sway, the college turned into a town-hall, and the
fine church, which seemed to mourn over the godless, careless,
semi-Gaucho population in the streets.&nbsp; Here we disposed of
our spare horses, bidding them good-bye, as they had been old
friends, and got the &ldquo;Bayo Overo&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Pateador&rdquo; shod for the first time in their lives, an
operation which took the united strength of half-a-dozen men to
achieve, but was imperative, as their feet, accustomed to the
stone-less plains of Paraguay, had suffered greatly in the
mountain paths.&nbsp; In Candelaria, for the first time for many
months, we sat down to a regular meal, in a building called
&ldquo;El Hotel Internacional&rdquo;; drank wine of a suspicious
kind, and seemed to have arrived in Paris, so great the change to
the wild camps beside the forests, or the nights passed in the
lone ranchos of the hilly district of Brazil.</p>
<p>A balsa drawn by a tug-boat took us across the Parana, here
more than a mile broad, to Ytapua, and upon landing we found
ourselves in quite another world.&nbsp; The little Paraguayan
town of Ytapua, called by the Jesuits Encarnacion, lay, with its
little port below it (where my friend Enrico Clerici had his
store), upon a plateau hanging above the stream.&nbsp; The
houses, built of canes and thatched with straw, differed
extremely from <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>the white &ldquo;azotea&rdquo; houses of the Candelaria
on the other side.&nbsp; The people, dress, the vegetation, and
the mode of life, differed still more in every aspect.&nbsp; The
Paraguayan, with his shirt hanging outside his white duck
trousers, bare feet, and cloak made of red cloth or baize, his
broad straw hat and quiet manner, was the complete antithesis of
the high-booted, loose-trousered, poncho-wearing Correntino, with
his long knife and swaggering Gaucho air.&nbsp; The one a
horseman of the plains, the other a footman of the forests; the
Correntino brave even to rashness when taken man for man, but so
incapable of discipline as to be practically useless as a
soldier.&nbsp; The other as quiet as a sheep, and individually
patient even to suffering blows, but once gathered together and
instructed in the use of arms, as good a soldier, when well led,
as it is possible to find; active and temperate, brave, and, if
rather unintelligent, eager to risk his life at any time at the
command of any of his chiefs.&nbsp; Such was the material from
which Lopez, coward and grossly incompetent as he was, formed the
battalions which for four years kept both Buenos Ayres and Brazil
at bay, and only yielded when he himself was killed, mounted, as
tradition has it, on the last horse of native breed left in the
land.</p>
<p>But if the people and their dwellings were dissimilar, the
countries in themselves were to the full at least as
different.&nbsp; All through the upper part <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>of Corrientes
the soil is black, and the country open, park-like prairie dotted
with trees; in Ytapua and the surrounding district, the earth
bright red, and the primeval forest stretches close to the
water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; In Corrientes still the trees of the
Pampas are occasionally seen, Talas and &ntilde;andubay with
Coronillo and Lapacho; whereas in Paraguay, as by a bound, you
pass to Curupay, <a name="citation60a"></a><a href="#footnote60a"
class="citation">[60a]</a> Tatan&eacute;, <a
name="citation60b"></a><a href="#footnote60b"
class="citation">[60b]</a> the Tarum&aacute;, <a
name="citation60c"></a><a href="#footnote60c"
class="citation">[60c]</a> the &Ntilde;andip&aacute;, <a
name="citation60d"></a><a href="#footnote60d"
class="citation">[60d]</a> the Jacaranda, and the Paratodo with
its bright yellow flowers; whilst upon every tree lianas cling
with orchidace&aelig;, known to the natives as &ldquo;flowers of
the air,&rdquo; and through them all flit great butterflies,
humming-birds dart, and underneath the damp vegetation of the
sub-tropics, emphorbiace&aelig;, solanace&aelig;, myrtace&aelig;,
and flowers and plants to drive a thousand botanists to madness,
blossom and die unnamed.&nbsp; Here, too, the language changed,
and Guarani became the dominant tongue, which, though spoken in
Corrientes, is there used but occasionally, but among Paraguayans
is their native speech, only the Alcaldes, officers, and upper
classes as a general rule (at that time) speaking Spanish, and
even then with a strange accent and much mixed with Guarani.</p>
<p>Two days we passed in Ytapua resting our horses, and I renewed
my friendship with Enrico Clerici, an Italian, who had served
with Garibaldi, <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>and who, three years ago, I had met in the same place
and given him a silver ring which he reported galvanized, and was
accustomed to lend as a great favour for a specific against
rheumatism.&nbsp; He kept a pulperia, and being a born fighter,
his delight was, when a row occurred (which he styled &ldquo;una
barulla de Jesu Cristo&rdquo;), to clear the place by flinging
empty bottles from the bar.&nbsp; A handsome, gentlemanlike man,
and terrible with a bottle in his hand, whether as weapon of
offence or for the purposes of drink; withal well educated, and
no doubt by this time long dead, slain by his favourite weapon,
and his place filled by some fat, double-entry Basque or grasping
Catalan, or by some portly emigrant from Germany.</p>
<p>Not wishing to be confined within a house, a prey to the
mosquitoes, we camped in the chief square, and strolling round
about the town, I came on an old friend.</p>
<p>Not far outside the village a Correntino butcher had his shop,
a little straw-thatched hut, with strings of fresh jerked beef
festooning all the place; the owner stood outside dressed in the
costume of a Gaucho of the southern plains.&nbsp; I did not know
him, and we began to talk, when I perceived, tied underneath a
shed, a fine, dark chestnut horse, saddled and bitted in the most
approved of Gaucho style.&nbsp; He somehow seemed familiar, and
the Correntino, seeing me looking at his horse, asked if I knew
the brand, but looking at it I failed to <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>recognize it,
when on a sudden my memory was lighted up.&nbsp; Three years ago,
in an &ldquo;estero&rdquo; <a name="citation62"></a><a
href="#footnote62" class="citation">[62]</a> outside
Caapuc&uacute;, at night, journeying in company with a friend,
one Hermann, whose only means of communication with me was a
jargon of Spanish mixed with &ldquo;Plaat Deutsch,&rdquo; we met
a Correntino, and as our horses mutually drowned our approach by
splashing with their feet, our meeting terrified us both.&nbsp;
Frightened, he drew his knife, and I a pistol, and Hermann lugged
out a rusty sword, which he wore stuck through his horse&rsquo;s
girths.&nbsp; But explanations followed, and no blood was shed,
and then we drew aside into a little hillock, called in the
language of the place an &ldquo;albardon,&rdquo; sat down and
talked, and asking whence he came was told from Ytapua.&nbsp; Now
Ytapua was three days&rsquo; journey distant on an ordinary
horse, and I looked carefully at the horse, and wondered why his
owner had ridden him so hard.&nbsp; He, I now saw, was the horse
I had seen that night, and the Correntino recognized me, and
laughing said he had killed a man near Ytapua, and was (as he
said) &ldquo;retreating&rdquo; when he met me in the marsh.&nbsp;
The horse, no doubt, was one of the best for a long journey I
have ever seen, and after quoting to his owner that &ldquo;a dark
chestnut horse may die, but cannot <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>tire,&rdquo; <a
name="citation63a"></a><a href="#footnote63a"
class="citation">[63a]</a> we separated, and, no doubt, for years
afterwards our meeting was the subject of his talk.</p>
<p>No doubt the citizens of Ytapua were scandalized at our not
coming to the town, and the Alcalde came to interview us, but we
assured him that in virtue of a vow we slept outside, and in a
moment all his fears were gone.</p>
<p>Striking right through the then desolated Misiones, passing
the river Aguapey, our horses almost swimming, skirting by
forests where red macaws hovered like hawks and parrots
chattered; passing through open plains grown over here and there
with Yatais, <a name="citation63b"></a><a href="#footnote63b"
class="citation">[63b]</a> splashing for hours through wet
esteros, missing the road occasionally, as I had travelled it but
once, and then three years ago, and at the time I write of huts
were few and far between, and population scanty, we came, upon
the evening of the second day, near to a place called
&Ntilde;acuti.&nbsp; This was the point for which I had been
making, for near it was an estancia <a name="citation63c"></a><a
href="#footnote63c" class="citation">[63c]</a> called the
&ldquo;Potrero San Antonio,&rdquo; the property of Dr. Stewart, a
well-known man in Paraguay.&nbsp; Nature had seemed to work to
make the place impregnable.&nbsp; On three sides of the land,
which measured eight or ten miles in length on every side, forks
of <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>a river
ran, and at the fourth they came so close together that a short
fence, not half-a-mile in length, closed up the circle, and
cattle once inside were safe but for the tigers, which at that
time abounded, and had grown so fierce by reason of the want of
population that they sometimes killed horses or cows close to the
door of the house.&nbsp; A short &ldquo;picada,&rdquo; of about a
quarter of a mile in length, cut through the wood, led to the
gate.&nbsp; Through it in times gone by I often rode at night in
terror, with a pistol in my hand, the heavy foliage of the trees
brushing my hat, and thinking every instant that a tiger would
jump out.&nbsp; One night when close up to the bamboo bars I
heard a grunt, thought my last hour had come, fired, and brought
something down; approached, and found it was a peccary; and then,
tearing the bars down in a hurry, got to horse, and galloped nine
miles to the house, thinking each moment that the herd of
peccaries was close behind and panting for my blood.</p>
<p>On this occasion all was still; the passage through the orange
trees was dark, their scent oppressive, as the leaves just
stirred in the hot north wind, and fire-flies glistened to and
fro amongst the flowers; great bats flew heavily, and the quarter
of a mile seemed mortal, and as if it led to hell.</p>
<p>Nothing occurred, and coming to the bars we found them on the
ground; putting them up we conscientiously cursed the fool who
left them out <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>of place, and riding out into the moonlight, after a
little trouble found the sandy, deep-banked trail which led up to
the house.&nbsp; All the nine miles we passed by islands of great
woods, peninsulas and archipelagos jutting out into the still
plain, and all their bases swathed in white mists like water: the
Yatais looked ghostly standing starkly in the grass; from the
lagoons came the shrill croak of frogs, great moths came
fluttering across our path, and the whole woods seemed filled
with noise, as if the dwellers in them, silent through the day,
were keeping holiday at night.&nbsp; As for the past two days we
had eaten nothing but a few oranges and pieces of jerked beef,
moistening them in the muddy water of the streams, our talk was
of the welcome we should get, the supper, and of the comfortable
time we then should pass for a few days to give our horses
rest.</p>
<p>We passed the tiger-trap, a structure built after the fashion
of an enormous mouse-trap, of strong bamboos; skirted along a
wood in which an ominous growling and rustling made our horses
start, and then it struck me as curious that there were no cattle
feeding in the plain, no horses, and that the whole potrero
seemed strangely desolate; but the house just showing at the edge
of a small grove of peach-trees drove all these speculations out
of my head: thinking upon the welcome, and the dinner, for we had
eaten nothing since daybreak, and were fasting, as the natives
say, from everything but sin, <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>we reached the door.&nbsp; The house
was dark, no troop of dogs rushed out to bark and seize our
horses&rsquo; tails; we shouted, hammered with our whips, fired
our revolvers, and nothing answered us.</p>
<p>Dismounting, we found everything bolted and barred, and going
to the back, on the kitchen-hearth a few red embers, and thus
knew that some one had been lately in the place.&nbsp; Nothing to
eat, the woods evidently full of tigers, and our horses far too
tired to start again, we were just about to unsaddle and lie down
and sleep, when a white figure stole out from the peach-trees,
and tried to gain the shelter of the corral some sixty yards
away.&nbsp; Jumping on horseback we gave chase, and coming up
with the fugitive found it to be a Paraguayan woman, who with her
little daughter were the sole inhabitants, her husband having
gone to the nearest village to buy provisions, and left her all
alone, warning her earnestly before he left to keep the doors
shut during the night on account of the tigers, and not to
venture near the woods even in daylight till he should have come
back.&nbsp; Finding herself confronted by two armed, mounted men,
dressed in the clothes of Correntinos, who had an evil reputation
in Paraguay, her terror was extreme.&nbsp; Her daughter, a little
girl of eight or nine, crept out from behind a tree, and in a
moment we were friends.&nbsp; Unluckily for us, she had no food
of any kind, and but a little mat&eacute;, which she <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>prepared for
us.&nbsp; She then remembered that the trees were covered with
peaches, and went out and gathered some, but they were hard as
stones; nevertheless we ate a quantity of them, and having tied
our horses close to the house, not twenty paces from the door, in
long lush grass, we lay down in the verandah, and did not wake
till it was almost noon.&nbsp; When we awoke we found the woman
had been up betimes and gone on foot five or six miles away to
look for food.&nbsp; She brought some mandioca, and two or three
dozen oranges, and a piece of almost putrefied jerked beef, all
which we ate as heartily as if it had been the most delicious
food on earth.</p>
<p>To my annoyance I found my horse weak and dejected, and
several large clots of dried-up blood under the hair of his mane,
and saw at once a vampire bat had fixed upon him, and no doubt
sucked almost a quart of blood.&nbsp; We washed him in a pond
close to the house, and he got better, and after eating some of
the hard and unripe peaches we again lay down to sleep.&nbsp; By
evening the woman&rsquo;s husband had returned, and proved to be
a little lame and withered-looking man, mounted upon a lean and
skinny horse.&nbsp; He undertook to guide us to Asuncion,
remarking that it was twenty years since he had seen the capital,
but that he knew the road as if he was accustomed to go there
every day.&nbsp; With a slight lapsus this turned out to be the
case, and just at daybreak we left the Potrero <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>San Antonio,
where once before I had passed a month roaming about the woods,
waiting for tigers in a tree at night, and never thinking that,
in three years&rsquo; time, I should return and find it
desolate.&nbsp; It seemed that Dr. Stewart, not finding the
speculation pay, had sold his cattle, and his manager, one
Oliver, a Californian &ldquo;Forty-niner,&rdquo; and his
Paraguayan wife, had removed to a place some twenty leagues away,
upon the road towards Asuncion.</p>
<p>There we determined to go and rest our horses, and left the
place, our guide Florencio&rsquo;s wife impressing on him to be
sure and bring her back a little missal from the capital, and he,
just like an Arab or an Indian leaving home, unmoved, merely
observing that the folk in Asuncion were &ldquo;muy ladino&rdquo;
(very cunning), and it behoved a Christian to take care.</p>
<p>A day&rsquo;s long march brought us near Santa Rosa, and our
guide here fell into his first and only error on the road.&nbsp;
Pursuing an interminable palm-wood, we came out upon a little
plain, all broken here and there with stunted Yatais, then to our
great disgust the road bifurcated, and our guide insisted on
striking to the left, though I was almost certain it was
wrong.&nbsp; After an hour of heavy ploughing through the sand, I
suddenly saw two immense palm-trees about a league away upon the
right, and luckily remembered that they stood one on each side of
the old Jesuit church at Santa Rosa, <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>and after an hour of scrambling
through a stony wood arrived at the crossing of the little river
just outside the place.&nbsp; Girls carrying water-jars upon
their heads, and dressed in long white shifts, embroidered round
the neck with coarse black lace, were going and coming in a long
procession to the stream.&nbsp; A few old men and about thirty
boys composed almost the entire male population of the
town.&nbsp; Women entirely ruled the roost, and managed
everything, and, as far as I can now recall, did it not much more
inefficiently than men.&nbsp; The curious wooden church, dark,
and with overhanging eaves, and all the images of saints still
left from Jesuit times in choir and nave, with columns hewn from
the trunks of massive trees, stood in the centre of the village,
which was built after the fashion of a miner&rsquo;s
&ldquo;row,&rdquo; or of a St. Simonian phalanstery, each
dwelling at least a hundred feet in length, and all partitioned
off in the inside for ten or fifteen families.&nbsp; The plaza
was overgrown with grass, and on it donkeys played, chasing each
other up and down, and sometimes running up the wooden steps of
the great church, and stumbling down again.&nbsp; Those who had
horses led them down to bathe, cut &ldquo;pindo&rdquo; <a
name="citation69"></a><a href="#footnote69"
class="citation">[69]</a> for them, rode them at evening time,
and passed their time in dressing and in combing them to get them
into condition for the Sunday&rsquo;s running at the ring, which
sport introduced by the Jesuits has continued popular in all <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>the villages
of the Misiones up to the present time.&nbsp; The women flirted
with the men, who by their rarity were at a premium, gave
themselves airs, and went about surrounded by a perpetual and
admiring band.&nbsp; The single little shop, which contained
needles, gunpowder, and gin, was kept by an Italian, who, as he
told me, liked the place, lent money, was a professing and quite
unabashed polygamist, and I have no doubt long ere this time has
made a fortune, and retired to live at Genoa in the self-same
green velvet suit in which he left his home.</p>
<p>In this Arcadia we remained some days, and hired several girls
to bathe the horses, which they performed most conscientiously,
splashing and shouting in the stream for hours at a time, and
bringing back the horses clean, and garnished with flowers in
their manes.&nbsp; I rode one day to see a village two or three
leagues away, where report said some of the Jesuit books had been
preserved; got lost, and passed the night in a small clearing,
where a fat and well-cared-for-looking handsome roan horse was
tied.&nbsp; On seeing me he broke his picket-rope, ran furiously
four or five times round me in circles, and then advancing put
his nostrils close to the nostrils of my horse, and seemed to
talk to him.&nbsp; His owner, an old Paraguayan, lame from a
wound received in jumping from a canoe onto the deck of a
Brazilian ironclad, told me his horse had been with him far into
the interior, and <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>for a year had never seen another horse.&nbsp; But, he
said, &ldquo;Tata Dios has given every animal its speech after
its kind, and he is glad to see your horse, and is no doubt
asking him the news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the night, I cannot say exactly what the two horses
talked about, but the old Paraguayan talked for hours of his
adventures in the lately terminated war.&nbsp; It appeared that
he, with seven companions, thinking to take a Brazilian ironclad
anchored in the Paraguay, concealed themselves in a small canoe,
behind some drift-wood, and floating plants called
&ldquo;camalotes,&rdquo; drifted down with the stream, and coming
to the ship jumped with a yell aboard.&nbsp; The Brazilians,
taken by surprise, all ran below, and the poor Paraguayans
thinking the ship was theirs, sat quietly down upon the deck to
plan what they should do.&nbsp; Seeing them off their guard, some
of the crew turned a gun upon them, and at the first fire killed
six, and wounded my host, who sprang into the stream, and gained
the bank, but most unluckily not on the Paraguayan side.&nbsp; As
at that time the Chaco Indians, who had profited by the war to
make invasions upon every side, killed every Christian, as my
host said &ldquo;sin perdon,&rdquo; so he remained half starving
for a night and day.&nbsp; On the third morning, wounded as he
was, and seeing he must starve or else be killed if seen by
Indians, he got a fallen tree, and with great difficulty, and
marvellously escaping the fierce fish who come like <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>wolves to the
scent of blood, and unmolested by the alligators, he reached the
other side.&nbsp; There he was found by some women, lying
unconscious on the river-bank, was cured, and though scarred in a
dozen places, and lame for life, escaped, as he informed me, by
his devotion to San Jos&eacute;, whom he described under the
title of the &ldquo;husband of the mother of our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning he rode a league with me upon the way, and as
we parted his horse neighed shrilly, reared once or twice, and
plunged, and when we separated I looked back and saw the devotee
of St. Joseph sitting as firmly as a centaur, as his horse loped
along the sandy palm-tree-bordered trail.&nbsp; During our stay
at Santa Rosa, which was an offshoot from the more important
mission of Santa Maria de F&eacute;, although they had no priest
the people gathered in the church, the Angelus was rung at
evening for the &ldquo;oracion,&rdquo; and every one on hearing
it took off his hat and murmured something that he thought
apposite.&nbsp; Thus did ceremony, always much more important
than mere faith, continue, and no doubt blessed the poor people
to the full as much as if it had been duly sanctified by a
tonsured priest, and consecrated by a rightly constituted
offertory.&nbsp; We left the place with real regret, and to this
day, when in our hurried life I dream of peace, my thoughts go
back to the old Paraguayan Jesuit &ldquo;capilla&rdquo; lost in
the woods of Morosimo, Curupay, and Yba-hai, and <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>with its two
tall feathery palm-trees rustling above the desecrated church; to
the long strings of white-robed women carrying water-jars, and to
the old-world life, perhaps by this time altered and swept away,
or yet again not altered, and passing still in the same quiet
fashion as when we were there.</p>
<p>Little by little we left the relatively open country of the
Misiones behind, and passing Ibyra-puc&uacute;, San Roque, and
Ximenes, came to the river Tebicuary.&nbsp; We passed it in
canoes, the horses swimming, with their backs awash and heads
emerging like water-monsters, whilst an impassive Indian paddled
in the stern, and a young girl stood in the bows wielding a
paddle like a water-sprite.&nbsp; The river passed, we got at
once into the forests, and followed winding and narrow paths,
worn by the footsteps of the mules of ages so deeply that our
heavy Gaucho spurs almost trailed on the ground, whilst overhead
lianas now and then quite formed a roof, and in the heavy air
winged animals of every kind made life a burden.&nbsp; At last,
leaving the little town of Quiquy&oacute; upon the right, we
emerged on to a high and barren plain near Caapuc&uacute;.&nbsp;
On the evening of the second day from where we crossed the river,
we came to Caballero Punta, just underneath a range of flattish
hills, and riding to the door at a sharp gallop, pulled up short,
and found ourselves greeted by the ex-manager of the Potrero San
Antonio, my friend the &ldquo;Forty-niner,&rdquo; and for the
first time for four months saw a familiar face.&nbsp; <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Gentle and
kindly, though quick on the trigger, as befitted one who had
crossed the plains in &rsquo;48 on foot, and with his whole
possessions packed on a bullock, passing the Rocky Mountains
alone, and through the hostile tribes at that time powerful and
savage, John Oliver was one of those strange men who, having
passed their lives in perils and privations, somehow draw from
them that very kindliness which those living in what appear more
favourable surroundings so often lack.&nbsp; Born somewhere in
the Yorkshire Dales (these he remembered well), and as he thought
&ldquo;back somewhere in the twenties,&rdquo; he had suffered all
his life from the strange fever which impels some men to search
for gold.&nbsp; Not on the Stock Exchange, or any of those places
where it might reasonably be expected to be found, but in
Australia, California, Mexico, in short wherever life was hard,
death easy, and experience to be gathered, he sought with pick
and shovel, rocker and pan and cradle, the &ldquo;yellow
iron,&rdquo; as the Apaches used to call it, which sought and
found after the fashion of his kind, enriches some one
else.&nbsp; From California he had drifted to Peru, from thence
to Chile, but finding silver-mining too laborious or too
lucrative for his conversing, and hearing of a fertile diggings
opened in the Republic of Uruguay, had migrated there, and
arrived somehow in Paraguay to find that the enchantment of his
life was done, and settled down to live.&nbsp; Tall, and with
long grey hair hanging in Western fashion <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>down his
back, a careful horseman after the style of the trappers of the
West, his pale blue eyes looked out upon the world as with an air
of doubt; yet he had served in San Francisco as a
&ldquo;vigilante,&rdquo; sojourned with Brigham Young in Salt
Lake City, leaving as he confessed two or three wives among the
saints, sat in Judge Lynch&rsquo;s court a dozen times, most
probably had killed a man or two; still, to my fancy, if the meek
are to inherit any portion of the earth, his share should not be
small.</p>
<p>He made us welcome, and his wife waited upon us, never
presuming to sit down and eat, but standing ready with a napkin
fringed with lace, to wipe our hands, pressing the food upon us,
and behaving generally as if she found herself in the presence of
some strange beings of an unfamiliar race.&nbsp; He said he had
no children and was glad of it, for he explained that
&ldquo;Juaneeter was a good woman, but &lsquo;uneddicated,&rsquo;
and he had never taken thoroughly to half-caste pups, though he
remembered some born of a Pi-Ute woman, way back somewhere about
the fifties, who he supposed by now were warriors, and had taken
many scalps.&rdquo;&nbsp; His wife stood by, not understanding
any English and but little Spanish, which he himself spoke badly,
and their talk was held in a strange jargon mixed with Guarani,
without a verb, without a particle, and yet sufficient for the
two simple creatures whom a strange fate, or a discerning,
ever-watchful Providence, had thus ordained to <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>meet.&nbsp;
No books were in the place, except a Bible, which he read little
of late years, partly from failing sight, and partly, as he said,
because he had detected what seemed to him
&ldquo;exaggerations,&rdquo; chiefly in figures and as to the
number of the unbelievers whom the Chosen People slew.&nbsp; Two
days or more, for time was taken no account of in his house, we
waited with him, talking late every night of Salt Lake, Brigham
Young, the Mountain-meadows Massacre, Kit Carson, Cochise and
Mangas Coloradas, and matters of that kind which interested him,
and which, when all is said, are just as interesting to those
attuned to them, as is polemical theology, theories of art,
systems of jurisprudence, the origin of the Atoll Islands, or any
of the wise futilities with which men stock their minds.&nbsp; We
parted on the third or fourth, or perhaps the fifth or sixth day,
knowing that we should never meet again, and taking off my silver
spurs I gave them to him, and he presented me with a light summer
poncho woven by his wife.&nbsp; Much did he thank me for my
visit, and made me swear never to pass the district without
stopping at his house.&nbsp; This I agreed to do, and if I pass
again either by Caballero Punta or by Caapuc&uacute;, I will keep
faith; but he, I fear, will have deceived me, and in the
churchyard of the &ldquo;capilla,&rdquo; under a palm-tree, with
a rough cross above him, I shall find my simple friend.</p>
<p>Three or four days of jogging steadily, passing <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>by Quindy,
and through the short &ldquo;estero&rdquo; of Acaai, which we
passed splashing for several hours up to the girths, brought us
to Paraguari, which, with its saddle-shaped mountain overhanging
it, stood out a mark for leagues upon the level plain.&nbsp;
Seldom in any country have I seen a railway so fall into the
landscape as did the line at the little terminus of this the only
railway in all Paraguay.&nbsp; The war had left the country
almost in ruins, business was at a standstill, food was scarce,
and but for a bale or two of tobacco, and a hide-sack or two of
yerba, the train went empty to and fro.&nbsp; But as the people
always wanted to go to the capital in search of work, six or
eight empty trucks were always sent with every train.&nbsp; On
them the people (mostly women) swarmed, seated like flies, upon
the top and sides, dangling their legs outside like people
sitting on a wharf, talking incessantly, all dressed in white,
and every one, down to the smallest children, smoking large
cigars.&nbsp; Six hours the passage took, if all went well, the
distance being under fifty miles.&nbsp; If aught went wrong, it
took a day or more, and at the bridges the trucks were all
unhooked and taken over separately, so rotten was the state of
the whole line, and in addition every here and there bridges had
been blown away during the war, and roughly rendered serviceable
by shoring up with wood.&nbsp; To meet a train labouring and
puffing through the woods, the people clustering like bees upon
the trucks, the engineer seated <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>in shirt-sleeves, whilst some women
stoked the fire, was much the same as it is to meet a caravan
meandering across the sands.&nbsp; If you desired to talk with
any one the train incontinently stopped, the passengers got out,
relit their cigarettes, the women begged, the time of day was
passed, and curiosity thus satisfied you passed on upon the road,
and the &ldquo;Maquina-guazu,&rdquo; <a name="citation78"></a><a
href="#footnote78" class="citation">[78]</a> as it was called,
pursued contentedly the jolting and uneven tenor of its
way.&nbsp; We naturally despised it, though the conductor,
scenting business, offered to take us and our horses at almost
any price we chose.</p>
<p>By the Laguna Ypocarai we took our way; skirting along its
eastern shores, then desolate, and the whole district almost
depopulated, we passed by palm-groves and deserted mandioca
patches, reed cottages in ruins, watched the flamingoes fishing
in the lake, the alligators lying motionless, and saw an Indian
all alone in a dug-out canoe, casting his line as placidly as he
had lived before the coming of the Spaniards to the land.&nbsp; A
red-blue haze hung on the waters of the lake, reflected from the
bright red earth, peeping between the trees, and on the islands
drifts of mist gave an effect as if the palms were parachutes
dropped from balloons, or perhaps despatched from earth to find
out whether in the skies there could be anything more lovely than
this quiet inland sea.&nbsp; Close to the top end of the lake
stands Aregua, once under the Mercenary friars of <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Asuncion,
who, as Azara says, having made the people of the place work for
them for near two hundred years, began to think they were indeed
their slaves, till an official sent from Spain in 1783 gave them
their liberty, and the Mercenaries (as he says) at once retreated
in disgust.&nbsp; Here we fell in with a compatriot, who at our
time of meeting him was drunk.&nbsp; He told us that he passed
his time after the fashion of the patriarchs in the Old
Testament, and on arriving at his house it seemed he was provided
with several wives, but of the flocks and herds, and other
trade-marks of his supposed estate, we saw no trace.&nbsp; Still
he was hospitable, setting the women to cut down pindo for the
horses, take them to water, bathe them, and finally to cook some
dinner for ourselves.&nbsp; His chief complaint was that his
wives were Catholics, and now and then trudged off to mass, and
left him without any one to cook his food.&nbsp; I doubted
personally if a change of creed would better things, but held my
peace, seeing the man set store by the faith which he had learnt
in youth and still said he practised, but, as far as I could see,
only by cursing the religion of the people of the place.&nbsp; We
left his house without regret, though he was hospitable and half
drunk for nearly all the time that we were there, and started on
our last day&rsquo;s march considerably refreshed by meeting one
who in a foreign land, far from home ties and moral influences,
yet still pursued the simple practice of the faith which he had
learned at home.</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Luque,
upon its little hill, the Campo Grande, like a dry lake,
surrounded by thick woods on every side, and then the Recoleta,
we passed, and entering the red sandy road made at the conquest
to move troops upon, we saw the churches of Asuncion only a
league away.&nbsp; And yet we lingered, walking our horses slowly
in the deep red sand, passing the strings of countrywomen with
baskets on their heads, driving their donkeys packed with
sugar-cane, and smoking as they went; we lingered, feeling that
the trip was done; not that we minded that our fortunes were not
made, but vaguely felt that for the last five months we had lived
a time which in our lives we should not see again, and fearing
rather than looking forward to all the approaching change.&nbsp;
The horses too were fat, in good condition, had become old
friends, knew us so well we never tied them, but all night in
camp left them to feed, being certain that they would not stray;
and thus to leave them at the end of a long trip seemed as
unreasonable as to part from an old friend simply because death
calls.</p>
<p>The road grew wider, passed through some scattered houses,
buried in orange and guayaba trees, ran through some open patches
where grew wild indigo and castor-oil plants, with a low
palm-scrub, entered a rancheria just outside the town, and then
turned to a sandy street which merged in a great market, where,
as it seemed, innumerable myriads were assembled, all chattering
at once, or <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>so it struck us coming from the open solitary plains and
the dark silent woods.&nbsp; The lowness of the river having
stopped the Brazilian mail-boat from coming down from Corumba, we
put up at the &ldquo;Casa Horrocks,&rdquo; the resort of all the
waifs and strays storm-bound in Paraguay.&nbsp; The town buried
in vegetation, the sandy streets, all of them watercourses after
a night&rsquo;s rain, the listless life, the donkeys straying to
and fro, the white-robed women, with their hair hanging down
their backs, and cut square on the forehead after the style so
usual amongst Iceland ponies, the great unfinished palaces, the
squares with grass five or six inches high, and over all the
reddish haze blending the palm-trees, houses, sandy streets, the
river and the distant Chaco into a copper-coloured whole at
sunset, rise to my memory like the reflection of a dream.&nbsp; A
dream seen in a convex mirror, opening away from me as years have
passed, the actual things, men, actions, and occurrences of daily
life seem swollen in it at the far end of some perspective, but
the impression of the whole fresh and clear-cut in memory,
standing out as boldly as the last day when on the
&ldquo;Pateador&rdquo; I had a farewell gallop on the
beach.&nbsp; Adios, &ldquo;Pateador,&rdquo; or &ldquo;till so
long&rdquo;&mdash;horses will be born as good, better, ten
thousand times more valuable, and dogs will eat them, but for
myself, and for the owner of the &ldquo;Bayo Overo,&rdquo; not
all the coursers of the sun could stir the reminiscences of
youth, of lonely <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>camping-grounds, long nights in drenching rain,
struggles with wind, wild gallops in the dark; the hopes and
fears of the five months when we went fortune-seeking, and by
God&rsquo;s mercy failed in our search, as the mere mention of
those names forgotten to all the world except ourselves.</p>
<p>Eight or ten days had passed away, and we grew quite familiar
with the chief features of the place, having made acquaintance
with the Brazilian officers of the army and the fleet, the German
apothecary, with Dr. Stewart, the chief European of the place,
when news came that the Brazilian mail-boat had at last
arrived.&nbsp; We bade our friends good-bye, entrusted both our
horses to the care of Horrocks, fed them ourselves for the last
time, and went on board the ship; a coppery haze hung over
everything, the heat raising a faint quivering in the air, the
thick yellowish water of the stream lapping against the
vessel&rsquo;s sides like oil, the boat shoved off, our friends
perspiring in the sun raising a washed-out cheer.&nbsp; The
vessel swung into the stream, her paddles turned, the great green
flag with the orange crown imperial flapped at the jackstaff, and
the town dropped rapidly astern.</p>
<p>A quarter of a league and the church towers, tall palm-trees,
the unfinished palaces, and the great theatre began to fade into
the haze.&nbsp; Then sheering a little to the Left bank, the
vessel passed a narrow tongue of land covered with grass, whereon
two horses fed.&nbsp; As we drew nearer I saw they <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>were our own,
and jumping on the taffrail shouted &ldquo;Adios,&rdquo; at which
they raised their heads, or perhaps raised them but at the
snorting steamer, and as they looked we passed racing down
stream, and by degrees they became dimmer, smaller, less
distinct, and at the last melted and vanished into the reddish
haze.</p>
<h2><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>IN A
GERMAN TRAMP</h2>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span><span
class="smcap">The</span> tall, flaxen-haired stewardess Matilda
had finished cutting Schwartzbrod and had gone to bed.&nbsp; The
Danish boarhound slept heavily under the lee of the
chicken-coops, the six or seven cats were upon the cabin sofa,
and with the wind from the south-west, raising a terrific sea,
and sending showers of spray flying over the tops of the black
rocks which fringed the town, the S.S. <i>Oldenburg</i> got under
way and staggered out into the gut.</p>
<p>The old white city girt on the seaward side by its breakwater
of tall black rocks, the houses dazzlingly white, the crenelated
walls, the long stretch of sand, extending to the belt of
grey-green scrub and backed in the distance by the sombre forest,
lay in the moonlight as distinct and clear as it had been
mid-day.&nbsp; Clearer perhaps, for the sun in a sandy landscape
seems to blur the outlines which the moon reveals; so that
throughout North Africa night is the time to see a town in all
its beauty of effect.&nbsp; The wind lifting the sand, drifted it
whistling through the standing rigging of the tramp, coating the
scarce dried paint, and making paint, rigging, and everything on
board feel <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>like a piece of shark-skin to the touch.&nbsp; The
vessel groaned and laboured in the surface sea, and on the port
quarter rose the rocks of the low island which forms the harbour,
leaving an entrance of about half-a-mile between its shores and
the rocks which guard the town.</p>
<p>West-south-west a little westerly, the wind ever increased;
the sea lashed on the vessel&rsquo;s quarter, and in spite of the
dense volumes of black smoke and showers of sparks flying out
from the salt-coated smoke-stack, the tramp seemed to stand
still.&nbsp; Upon the bridge the skipper screamed hoarsely in
Platt-Deutsch down his connection-tube to the chief engineer; men
came and went in dirty blue check cotton clothes and wooden
shoes; occasionally a perspiring fireman poked his head above the
hatch, and looking seaward for a moment, scooped off the sweat
from his forefinger, muttered, &ldquo;Gott freduma,&rdquo; and
went below; even the Arab deck-hands, roused into activity,
essayed to set a staysail, and the whole ship, shaken between the
storm and the exertions of the crew, trembled and shivered in the
yeasty sea.&nbsp; Nearer the rocks appeared, and the white town
grew clearer, more intensely white, the sea frothed round the
vessel, and the skipper advancing to a missionary seated silently
gazing across the water with a pallid sea-green face, slapped him
upon the back, and with an oath said, &ldquo;Mister, will you
have one glass of beer?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Levite in partibus, clad
in his black <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>alpaca Norfolk jacket, grey greasy flannel shirt and
paper collar, with the whole man surmounted by the inevitable
pith soup-tureen-shaped hat, the trade-mark of his confraternity,
merely pressed both his hands harder upon his diaphragm and
groaned.&nbsp; &ldquo;One leetel glass beer, I have it from
Olten, fifty dozen of it.&nbsp; Perhaps all to be wasted; have a
glass beer, it will do your shtomag good.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
persecuted United Presbyterian ambulant broke silence with one of
those pious ejaculations which do duty (in the congregations) for
an oath, and taking up his parable, fixing the pith tureen upon
his head with due precaution, said, &ldquo;Captain, ye see I am a
total abstainer, joined in the Whifflet, and in addeetion I feel
my stomach sort o&rsquo; discomposed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to him
again, good Captain Rindelhaus rejoined, &ldquo;Well, Mister
Missionary, do you see dat rocks?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Reverend Mr.
McKerrochar, squinting to leeward with an agonizing stare,
admitted that he did, but qualified by saying, &ldquo;there was
sic a halgh, he was na sure that they were rocks at
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not rocks!&nbsp; Kreuz-Sacrament, dose
rocks you see are sharp as razors, and the back-wash off them
give you no jance; I dell you, sheep&rsquo;s-head preacher, dat
point de way like signboard and not follow it oop himself, you
better take glass beer in time, for if the schip not gather
headway in about five minutes you perhaps not get another
jance.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this dictum, he stood looking into the
night, his glass gripped in his left <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>hand, and in his right a
half-smoked-out cigar, which he put to his mouth mechanically now
and then, but drew no smoke from it.&nbsp; The missionary too
looked at the rocks with increased interest, and the Arab pilot
staggering up the ladder to the bridge stolidly pointed to the
surf, and gave us his opinion, that &ldquo;he, the captain and
the faqui would soon be past the help of prayer,&rdquo; piously
adding, &ldquo;that it seemed Allah&rsquo;s will; although he
thought the Kaffirs, sons of burnt Kaffirs, in the stoke-hole
were not firing up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With groans and heavings, with long shivers which came over
her as the sea struck her on the beam, the vessel fought for her
life, belching great clouds of smoke out into the clear night
air.&nbsp; Captain and missionary, pilot and crew, stood gazing
at the sea; the captain now and then yelling some unintelligible
Platt-Deutsch order down the tube; the missionary fumbling with a
Bible lettered &ldquo;Polyglot,&rdquo; covered in black
oil-cloth; and the pilot passing his beads between the fingers of
his right hand, his eyes apparently not seeing anything; and it
seemed as if another twenty minutes must have seen them all upon
the rocks.</p>
<p>But Allah perhaps was on the watch; and the wind falling for
an instant, or the burnt Kaffirs in the stoke-hole having struck
a better vein of coal, the rusty iron sea-coffin slowly gathered
headway, staggered as the engines driven to the highest pressure
seemed to tear out her ribs, and forged <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>ahead.&nbsp;
Then lurching in the sea, the screw occasionally racing with a
roar, and the black decks dripping and under water, the scuppers
being choked with the filth of years, she sidled out to sea, and
rose and fell in the long rollers outside the harbour, which came
in from the west.&nbsp; Rindelhaus set her on her course, telling
the Arab helmsman in the pigeon-English which served them as a
means of interchanging their few ideas, &ldquo;to keep her head
north and by west a little northerly, and let him know when they
were abreast of Jibel Hadid;&rdquo; adding a condemnation of the
Arab race in general and the particular sailor, whom he
characterized as a &ldquo;tamned heaven dog, not worth his
kraut.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sailor, dressed in loose Arab trousers
and a blue jersey, the whole surmounted by a greasy fez, replied:
&ldquo;Yes, him know Jibel Hadid, captain, him keep her head
north and by west all right,&rdquo; and probably also consigned
the captain and the whole Germanic race to the hottest corner of
Jehannum, and so both men were pleased.&nbsp; The boarhound
gambolled on the deck, Matilda peeped up the companion, her
dripping wooden shoes looking like waterlogged canoes, and the
Scotch missionary began to walk about, holding his monstrous hat
on with one hand and hugging the oilskin-covered
&ldquo;Polyglot&rdquo; under his left arm.&nbsp; Crossing the
skipper in his walk, in a more cheerful humour he ventured to
remark: &ldquo;Eh! captain, maybe I could mak&rsquo; a shape at
yon glass of beer <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>the now.&rdquo;&nbsp; But things had changed, and
Rindelhaus looked at him with the usual uncondescending bearing
of the seaman to the mere passenger, and said: &ldquo;Nein, you
loose your obbordunity for dat glass beer, my friend, and now I
have to navigate my ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Oldenburg</i> pursued the devious tenor of her way,
touching at ports which all were either open roadsteads or had
bars on which the surf boiled with a noise like thunder;
receiving cargo in driblets, a sack or two of marjoram, a bale of
goatskins or of hides, two or three bags of wool, and sometimes
waiting for a day or two unable to communicate until the surf
went down.&nbsp; The captain spent his time in harbour fishing
uninterestedly, catching great bearded spiky-finned sea-monsters
which he left to die upon the deck.&nbsp; Not that he was
hard-hearted, but merely unimaginative, after the way of those
who, loving sport for the pleasure it affords themselves, hotly
deny that it is cruel, or that it can occasion inconvenience to
any participator in a business which they themselves enjoy.&nbsp;
So the poor innocent sea-monsters floundered in slimy agony upon
the deck; the boarhound and the cats taking a share in martyring
them, tearing and biting at them as they gasped their lives away;
condemned to agony for some strange reason, or perhaps because,
as every living thing is born to suffer, they were enduring but
their fair proportion, as they happened to be fish.&nbsp; <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Pathetic but
unwept, the tragedy of all the animals, and we but links in the
same chain with them, look at it all as unconcerned as
gods.&nbsp; But as the bearded spiky fish gasped on the deck the
missionary tried to abridge their agony with a belaying-pin;
covering himself with blood and slime, and setting up the back of
Captain Rindelhaus, who vowed his deck should not be hammered
&ldquo;like a skidel alley, all for the sake of half-a-dozen
fish, which would be dead in half-an-hour and eaten by the
cats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The marvels of our commerce, in the shape of Waterbury
watches, scissors and looking-glasses, beads, Swiss clocks, and
musical-boxes, all duly dumped, and the off-scouring of the trade
left by the larger ships duly received on board, the
<i>Oldenburg</i> stumbled out to sea if the wind was not too
strong, and squirmed along the coast.&nbsp; Occasionally upon
arrival at a port the sound of psalmody was heard, and a
missionary boat put off to pass the time of God with their
brother on the ship.&nbsp; Then came the greetings, as the whole
party sat on the fiddlee gratings jammed up against the funnel;
the latest news from the Cowcaddens and the gossip from along the
coast was duly interchanged.&nbsp; Gaunt-featured girls, removed
by physical conditions from all temptation, sat and talked with
scraggy, freckled, and pith-hatted men.&nbsp; It was all
conscience, and relatively tender heart, and as the moon lit up
the dirty decks, they paraded up <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>and down, happy once more to be
secure even for a brief space from insult, and to feel themselves
at home.&nbsp; Dressed in white blouses, innocent of stays, with
skirts which no belt known to milliners could ever join to the
body or the blouse; with smaller-sized pith hats, sand-shoes and
spectacles; their hands in Berlin gloves, and freckles reaching
far down upon their necks, they formed a crushing argument in
their own persons against polygamy.&nbsp; Still, in the main, all
kindly souls, and some with a twinkle in their white-eyelashed
steel-grey eyes, as of a Congregationalist bull-terrier, which
showed you that they would gladly suffer martyrdom without due
cause, or push themselves into great danger, out of sheer
ignorance and want of knowledge of mankind.&nbsp; Life&rsquo;s
misfits, most of them; their hands early inured to typewriting
machines, their souls, as they would say, &ldquo;sair hodden doon
in prayer;&rdquo; carefully educated to be ashamed of any scrap
of womanhood they might possess.&nbsp; Still they were
sympathetic, for sympathy is near akin to tears, and looking at
them one divined they must have shed tears plentifully, enough to
wash away any small sins they had committed in their lives.</p>
<p>The men, sunburnt yet sallow, seemed nourished on tinned meats
and mineral table-waters; their necks scraggy and red protruded
from their collars like those of vultures; they carried umbrellas
in their hands from early habit of a wet climate, and seemed as
if they had been chosen after much <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>cogitation by some unskilled
commission, for their unfitness for their task.</p>
<p>They too, dogged and narrow-minded as they were, were yet
pathetic, when one thought upon their lives.&nbsp; No hope of
converts, or of advancement in the least degree, stuck down upon
the coast, far off from Dorcas meetings, school-feasts, or
anything which in more favoured countries whiles away the
Scripture-reader&rsquo;s time; they hammered at their
self-appointed business day by day and preached unceasingly,
apparently indifferent to anything that passed, so that they got
off their due quantity of words a day.&nbsp; In course of time,
and after tea and bread-and-butter had been consumed, they got
into their boat, struck up the tune of &ldquo;Sidna Aissa
Hobcum,&rdquo; and from the taffrail McKerrochar saw them depart,
joining in the chorus lustily and waving a dirty handkerchief
until they faded out of sight.&nbsp; Mr. McKerrochar, one of
those Scottish professional religionists, whom early training or
their own &ldquo;damnable iteration&rdquo; has convinced of all
the doctrine that they preach, formed a last relic of a
disappearing type.&nbsp; The antiquated out-and-out doctrine of
Hellfire and of Paradise, the jealous Scottish God, and the
Mosaic Dispensation which he accepted whole, tinged slightly with
the current theology of Airdrie or Coatbridge, made him a
formidable adversary to the trembling infidel, in religious
strife.&nbsp; In person he was tall and loosely built, his
trousers bagging <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>at the knees as if a horse&rsquo;s hock had been inside
the cloth.&nbsp; Wrong-headed as befits his calling, he yet saw
clearly enough in business matters, and might have marked a flock
of heathen sheep had he applied his business aptitude to his
religious work, or on the other hand he might have made a fortune
had he chanced to be a rogue.&nbsp; He led a joyless stirring
life, striving towards ideals which have made the world a
quagmire; yet worked towards them with that simple faith which
makes a man ten thousand times more dangerous, in his
muddle-headed course.&nbsp; Abstractions which he called duty,
morality, and self-sacrifice, ruled all his life; forcing him
ever onward to occupy himself with things which really he had no
concern with; and making him neglect himself and the more human
qualities of courtesy and love.&nbsp; And so he stood, waving his
pocket-handkerchief long after the strains of &ldquo;Sidna Aissa
Hobcum&rdquo; had melted into the night air; his arms still
waving as the sails of windmills move round once or twice, but
haltingly, after the wind has dropped.&nbsp; Perhaps that class
of man seldom or never chews the cud either of sweet or bitter
recollection; and if, as in McKerrochar&rsquo;s case, he is
deprived of whisky in which to drown his cares, the last
impression gone, his mind hammers away, like the keys of a loose
typewriter under a weary operator&rsquo;s hands, half aimlessly,
till circumstances place new copy under its roller, and it starts
off again to work.</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>He
might have gone on waving right through the dog-watch had not the
captain with a rough ejaculation stopped his arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Himmel, what for a semaphore, Herr missionary, is dat; and
you gry too, when you look at dat going-way boat . . .&nbsp;
Well, have a glass of beer.&nbsp; I tell you it is not good to
look at boats and gry for noddings, for men that have an ugly
yellow beard like yours and mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was na greetin&rsquo;, captain,&rdquo; said the
missionary, furtively wiping his face; &ldquo;it was just ane of
thae clinkers, I think thae ca&rsquo; the things, has got into my
eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glinkers, mein friend, do not get into people&rsquo;s
eyes when der ship is anchored,&rdquo; Rindelhaus replied;
&ldquo;still I know as you feel, but not for missionary
boats.&nbsp; You not know Oldenburg eh?&nbsp; Pretta place; not
far from Bremerhaven.&nbsp; Oldenburg is one of the prettaest
places in the world.&nbsp; I live dere.&nbsp; Hour and half by
drain, oot from de port.&nbsp; I just can see the vessels&rsquo;
masts and the funnel smoke as they pass oop and down the
stream.&nbsp; I think I should not care too much to live where
man can see no ships.&nbsp; Yes, yes, ah, here come Matilda mit
de beer.&nbsp; Mein herz, you put him down here on dis bale of
marjoram, and you goes off to bed.&nbsp; I speak here mit de Herr
missionary, who gry for noddings when he look at missionary boat
go off into de night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Oldenburg, ja, yes, I live there.&nbsp; Meine <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>wife she live
there, and meine littel Gretchen, she about den or twelve, I
don&rsquo;t remember which.&nbsp; Prosit, Herr missionary, you
have no wife; no littel Gretchen, eh?&nbsp; So, so, dat is
perhaps better for a missionary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two sat looking at nothing, thinking in the painful
ruminant way of semi-educated men, the captain&rsquo;s burly
North-German figure stretched on a cane deck-chair.&nbsp; About a
captain&rsquo;s age he was, that is, his beard had just begun to
grizzle, and his nose was growing red, the bunions on his feet
knotted his boots into protuberances, after the style of those
who pass their lives about a deck.&nbsp; In height above six
feet, broad-shouldered and red-faced, his voice of the kind with
which a huntsman rates a dog, his clothes bought at a Bremerhaven
slop-shop, his boots apparently made by a portmanteau-maker, and
in his pocket was a huge silver keyless watch which he said was a
&ldquo;gronometer,&rdquo; and keep de Bremen time.&nbsp; Instant
in prayer and cursing; pious yet blasphemous; kindly but brutal
in the Teutonic way; he kicked his crew about as they had all
been dogs, and yet looked after the tall stewardess Matilda as
she had been his child; guarding her virtue from the assaults of
passengers, and though alone with her in the small compass of a
ship, respecting it himself.</p>
<p>After an interval he broke into his subject, just as a
phonograph takes up its interrupted tale, as if against its
will.</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>&ldquo;So ja, yes, Oldenburg, pretta place; I not see it
often though.&nbsp; In all eight years I never stay more to my
house than from de morning Saturday to Monday noon, and dat after
a four months&rsquo; trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meine wife, she getting little sdout, and not mind
much, for she is immer washing; washing de linen, de house, de
steps; she wash de whole ship oop only I never let her come to
see.&nbsp; The Gretchen she immer say, &lsquo;Father, why you not
stop to home?&rsquo;&nbsp; You got no littel Gretchen, eh?&nbsp;
. . .&nbsp; Well, perhaps better so.&nbsp; Last Christmas I was
at Oldenburg.&nbsp; Christmas eve I buy one tree, and then I
remember I have to go to sea next morning about eleven
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; So I say nodings all the day, and about four
o&rsquo;clock the agent come and tell me that the company not
wish me leave Oldenburg upon de Christmas day.&nbsp; Then I was
so much glad I think I wait to eat meine Christmas dinner with
meine wife, and talk with Gretchen in the evening while I smoke
my pipe.&nbsp; The stove was burning, and the table stand ready
mit sausage and mit bread and cheese, beer of course, and lax,
dat lax they bring from Norway, and I think I have good
time.&nbsp; Then I think on de company, what they say if I take
favour from them and go not out to sea; they throw it in my teeth
for ever, and tell me, &lsquo;Rindelhaus, you remember we was so
good to you upon that Christmas day.&rsquo;&nbsp; I tell the
agent thank you, but say I go to sea.&nbsp; Meine wife: she gry
and I say nodings, nodings to Gretchen, <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>and sit
down to take my tea.&nbsp; Morning, I tell my littel girl, then
she gry bitterly and say, &lsquo;What for you go to
sea?&rsquo;&nbsp; I kiss meine wife and walk down to the quay; it
just begin to snow; I curse the schelm sailors, de pilot come
aboard, and we begin to warp into the stream.&nbsp; Just then I
hear a running on the quay, like as a Friesland pony come
clattering on the stones.&nbsp; I look up and see Gretchen mit
her little wooden shoes.&nbsp; She run down to the ship, and say,
&lsquo;Why you go sea, father, upon Christmas day?&rsquo; and I
not able to say nodings but just to wave my hand.&nbsp; We warp
out into the stream, and she stand grying till she faded out of
sight.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel a liddel sorry about dat Christmas
day . . .&nbsp; But have another glass beer, Herr missionary, it
always do me good.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wiping the froth from his
moustache with his rough hand he went below, leaving the
missionary alone upon the deck.</p>
<p>The night descended, and the ship shrouded in mist grew
ghostly and unnatural, whilst great drops of moisture hung on the
backstays and the shrouds.</p>
<p>The Arab crew lay sleeping, huddled round the windlass,
looking mere masses of white dirty rags; the seaman keeping the
anchor-watch loomed like a giant, and from the shore occasionally
the voices of the guards at the town prison came through the
mist, making the boarhound turn in his sleep and growl.&nbsp; The
missionary paced to and fro a little, <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>settling his pith tureen-shaped hat
upon his head, and fastening a woollen comforter about his
neck.</p>
<p>Then going to the rail, he looked into the night where the
boat bearing off his brethren had disappeared; his soul perhaps
wandering towards some Limbo as he gazed, and his elastic-sided
boots fast glued to the dirty decks by the half-dried-up blood of
the discarded fish.</p>
<h2><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>THE
GOLD FISH</h2>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span><span
class="smcap">Outside</span> the little straw-thatched
<i>caf&eacute;</i> in a small courtyard trellised with vines,
before a miniature table painted in red and blue, and upon which
stood a dome-shaped pewter teapot and a painted glass half filled
with mint, sat Amarabat, resting and smoking hemp.&nbsp; He was
of those whom Allah in his mercy (or because man in the
Blad-Allah has made no railways) has ordained to run.&nbsp; Set
upon the road, his shoes pulled up, his waistband tightened, in
his hand a staff, a palm-leaf wallet at his back, and in it
bread, some hemp, a match or two (known to him as el spiritus),
and a letter to take anywhere, crossing the plains, fording the
streams, struggling along the mountain-paths, sleeping but
fitfully, a burning rope steeped in saltpetre fastened to his
foot, he trotted day and night&mdash;untiring as a camel,
faithful as a dog.&nbsp; In Rabat as he sat dozing, watching the
greenish smoke curl upwards from his hemp pipe, word came to him
from the Khalifa of the town.&nbsp; So Amarabat rose, paid for
his tea with half a handful of defaced and greasy copper coins,
and took his way towards the white palace with the crenelated
walls, which on the cliff, hanging <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>above the roaring tide-rip, just
inside the bar of the great river, looks at Salee.&nbsp; Around
the horseshoe archway of the gate stood soldiers, wild,
fierce-eyed, armed to the teeth, descendants, most of them, of
the famed warriors whom Sultan Muley Ismail (may God have
pardoned him!) bred for his service, after the fashion of the
Carlylean hero Frederic; and Amarabat walked through them, not
aggressively, but with the staring eyes of a confirmed
hemp-smoker, with the long stride of one who knows that he is
born to run, and the assurance of a man who waits upon his
lord.&nbsp; Some time he waited whilst the Khalifa dispensed what
he thought justice, chaffered with Jewish pedlars for cheap
European goods, gossiped with friends, looked at the antics of a
dwarf, or priced a Georgian or Circassian girl brought with more
care than glass by some rich merchant from the East.&nbsp; At
last Amarabat stood in the presence, and the Khalifa, sitting
upon a pile of cushions playing with a Waterbury watch, a pistol
and a Koran by his side, addressed him thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amarabat, son of Bjorma, my purpose is to send thee to
Tafilet, where our liege lord the Sultan lies with his
camp.&nbsp; Look upon this glass bowl made by the Kaffir, but
clear as is the crystal of the rock; see how the light falls on
the water, and the shifting colours that it makes, as when the
Bride of the Rain stands in the heavens, after a shower in
spring.&nbsp; Inside are seven gold fish, each <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>scale as
bright as letters in an Indian book.&nbsp; The Christian from
whom I bought them said originally they came from the Far East
where the Djin-descended Jawi live, the little yellow people of
the faith.&nbsp; That may be, but such as they are, they are a
gift for kings.&nbsp; Therefore, take thou the bowl.&nbsp; Take
it with care, and bear it as it were thy life.&nbsp; Stay not,
but in an hour start from the town.&nbsp; Delay not on the road,
be careful of the fish, change not their water at the muddy pool
where tortoises bask in the sunshine, but at running brooks; talk
not to friends, look not upon the face of woman by the way,
although she were as a gazelle, or as the maiden who when she
walked through the fields the sheep stopped feeding to
admire.&nbsp; Stop not, but run through day and night, pass
through the Atlas at the Glaui; beware of frost, cover the bowl
with thine own haik; upon the other side shield me the bowl from
the Saharan sun, and drink not of the water if thou pass a day
athirst when toiling through the sand.&nbsp; Break not the bowl,
and see the fish arrive in Tafilet, and then present them, with
this letter, to our lord.&nbsp; Allah be with you, and his
Prophet; go, and above all things see thou breakest not the
bowl.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Amarabat, after the manner of his kind,
taking the bowl of gold fish, placed one hand upon his heart and
said: &ldquo;Inshallah, it shall be as thou hast said.&nbsp; God
gives the feet and lungs.&nbsp; He also gives the luck upon the
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he passed out under the horseshoe arch, <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>holding the
bowl almost at arm&rsquo;s length so as not to touch his legs,
and with the palmetto string by which he carried it, bound round
with rags.&nbsp; The soldiers looked at him, but spoke not, and
their eyes seemed to see far away, and to pass over all in the
middle distance, though no doubt they marked the smallest detail
of his gait and dress.&nbsp; He passed between the horses of the
guard all standing nodding under the fierce sun, the reins tied
to the cantles of their high red saddles, a boy in charge of
every two or three: he passed beside the camels resting by the
well, the donkeys standing dejected by the firewood they had
brought: passed women, veiled white figures going to the baths;
and passing underneath the lofty gateway of the town, exchanged a
greeting with the half-mad, half-religious beggar just outside
the walls, and then emerged upon the sandy road, between the aloe
hedges, which skirts along the sea.&nbsp; So as he walked, little
by little he fell into his stride; then got his second wind, and
smoking now and then a pipe of hemp, began, as Arabs say, to cat
the miles, his eyes fixed on the horizon, his stick stuck down
between his shirt and back, the knob protruding over the left
shoulder like the hilt of a two-handed sword.&nbsp; And still he
held the precious bowl from Franquestan in which the golden fish
swam to and fro, diving and circling in the sunlight, or flapped
their tails to steady themselves as the water danced with the
motion of his steps.&nbsp; Never before in his experience had he
<a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>been
charged with such a mission, never before been sent to stand
before Allah&rsquo;s vicegerent upon earth.&nbsp; But still the
strangeness of his business was what preoccupied him most.&nbsp;
The fish like molten gold, the water to be changed only at
running streams, the fish to be preserved from frost and sun; and
then the bowl: had not the Khalifa said at the last,
&ldquo;Beware, break not the bowl&rdquo;?&nbsp; So it appeared to
him that most undoubtedly a charm was in the fish and in the
bowl, for who sends common fish on such a journey through the
land?&nbsp; Then he resolved at any hazard to bring them safe and
keep the bowl intact, and trotting onward, smoked his hemp, and
wondered why he of all men should have had the luck to bear the
precious gift.&nbsp; He knew he kept his law, at least as far as
a poor man can keep it, prayed when he thought of prayer, or was
assailed by terror in the night alone upon the plains; fasted in
Ramadan, although most of his life was one continual fast; drank
of the shameful but seldom, and on the sly, so as to give offence
to no believer, and seldom looked upon the face of the strange
women, Daughters of the Illegitimate, whom Sidna Mohammed himself
has said, avoid.&nbsp; But all these things he knew were done by
many of the faithful, and so he did not set himself up as of
exceeding virtue, but rather left the praise to God, who helped
his slave with strength to keep his law.&nbsp; Then left off
thinking, judging the matter was ordained, and trotted, trotted
over the burning plains, the gold fish <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>dancing in
the water as the miles melted and passed away.</p>
<p>Duar and Kasbah, castles of the Caids, Arabs&rsquo; black
tents, suddra zaribas, camels grazing&mdash;antediluvian in
appearance&mdash;on the little hills, the muddy streams edged all
along the banks with oleanders, the solitary horsemen holding
their long and brass-hooped guns like spears, the white-robed
noiseless-footed travellers on the roads, the chattering storks
upon the village mosques, the cow-birds sitting on the cattle in
the fields&mdash;he saw, but marked not, as he trotted on.&nbsp;
Day faded into night, no twilight intervening, and the stars
shone out, Soheil and Rigel with Betelgeuse and Aldebaran, and
the three bright lamps which the cursed Christians know as the
Three Maries&mdash;called, he supposed, after the mother of their
Prophet; and still he trotted on.&nbsp; Then by the side of a
lone palm-tree springing up from a cleft in a tall rock, an
island on the plain, he stopped to pray; and sleeping, slept but
fitfully, the strangeness of the business making him wonder; and
he who cavils over matters in the night can never rest, for thus
the jackal and the hyena pass their nights talking and reasoning
about the thoughts which fill their minds when men lie with their
faces covered in their haiks, and after prayer sleep.&nbsp;
Rising after an hour or two and going to the nearest stream, he
changed the water of his fish, leaving a little in the bottom of
the bowl, and dipping with his brass drinking-cup into the stream
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>for fear
of accidents.&nbsp; He passed the Kasbah of el Daudi, passed the
land of the Rahamna, accursed folk always in &ldquo;siba,&rdquo;
saw the great snowy wall of Atlas rise, skirted Marakesh, the
Kutubieh, rising first from the plain and sinking last from sight
as he approached the mountains and left the great white city
sleeping in the plain.</p>
<p>Little by little the country altered as he ran: cool streams
for muddy rivers, groves of almond-trees, ashes and elms, with
grape-vines binding them together as the liana binds the canela
and the urunday in the dark forests of Brazil and Paraguay.&nbsp;
At mid-day, when the sun was at its height, when locusts,
whirring through the air, sank in the dust as flying-fish sink in
the waves, when palm-trees seem to nod their heads, and lizards
are abroad drinking the heat and basking in the rays, when the
dry air shimmers, and sparks appear to dance before the
traveller&rsquo;s eye, and a thin, reddish dust lies on the
leaves, on clothes of men, and upon every hair of horses&rsquo;
coats, he reached a spring.&nbsp; A river springing from a rock,
or issuing after running underground, had formed a little
pond.&nbsp; Around the edge grew bulrushes, great catmace,
water-soldiers, tall arums and metallic-looking sedge-grass,
which gave an air as of an outpost of the tropics lost in the
desert sand.&nbsp; Fish played beneath the rock where the stream
issued, flitting to and fro, or hanging suspended for an instant
in the clear stream, darted into the dark recesses of the sides;
and in <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>the middle of the pond enormous tortoises, horrid and
antediluvian-looking, basked with their backs awash or raised
their heads to snap at flies, and all about them hung a dark and
fetid slime.</p>
<p>A troop of thin brown Arab girls filled their tall amphora
whilst washing in the pond.&nbsp; Placing his bowl of fish upon a
jutting rock, the messenger drew near.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gazelles,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will one of you give me
fresh water for the Sultan&rsquo;s golden fish?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Laughing and giggling, the girls drew near, looked at the bowl,
had never seen such fish.&nbsp; &ldquo;Allah is great; why do you
not let them go in the pond and play a little with their
brothers?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Amarabat with a shiver answered,
&ldquo;Play, let them play! and if they come not back my life
will answer for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fear fell upon the girls, and
one advancing, holding the skirt of her long shift between her
teeth to veil her face, poured water from her amphora upon the
fish.</p>
<p>Then Amarabat, setting down his precious bowl, drew from his
wallet a pomegranate and began to eat, and for a farthing buying
a piece of bread from the women, was satisfied, and after
smoking, slept, and dreamed he was approaching Tafilet; he saw
the palm-trees rising from the sand; the gardens; all the oasis
stretching beyond his sight; at the edge the Sultan&rsquo;s camp,
a town of canvas, with the horses, camels, and the mules
picketed, all in rows, and in the midst of the great
&ldquo;duar&rdquo; the Sultan&rsquo;s tent, like a great palace
all of canvas, <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>shining in the sun.&nbsp; All this he saw, and saw
himself entering the camp, delivering up his fish, perhaps
admitted to the sacred tent, or at least paid by a vizier, as one
who has performed his duty well.&nbsp; The slow match blistering
his foot, he woke to find himself alone, the
&ldquo;gazelles&rdquo; departed, and the sun shining on the bowl,
making the fish appear more magical, more wondrous, brighter, and
more golden than before.</p>
<p>And so he took his way along the winding Atlas paths, and
slept at Demnats, then, entering the mountains, met long trains
of travellers going to the south.&nbsp; Passing through groves of
chestnuts, walnut-trees, and hedges thick with blackberries and
travellers&rsquo; joy, he climbed through vineyards rich with
black Atlas grapes, and passed the flat mud-built Berber villages
nestling against the rocks.&nbsp; Eagles flew by and moufflons
gazed at him from the peaks, and from the thickets of lentiscus
and dwarf arbutus wild boars appeared, grunted, and slowly walked
across the path, and still he climbed, the icy wind from off the
snow chilling him in his cotton shirt, for his warm Tadla haik
was long ago wrapped round the bowl to shield the precious
fish.&nbsp; Crossing the Wad Ghadat, the current to his chin, his
bowl of fish held in one hand, he struggled on.&nbsp; The Berber
tribesmen at Tetsula and Zarkten, hard-featured, shaved but for a
chin-tuft, and robed in their &ldquo;achnifs&rdquo; with the
curious eye woven in the skirt, saw he was a
&ldquo;rekass,&rdquo; or thought the <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>fish not worth their notice, so gave
him a free road.&nbsp; Night caught him at the stone-built,
antediluvian-looking Kasbah of the Glaui, perched in the eye of
the pass, with the small plain of Teluet two thousand feet
below.&nbsp; Off the high snow-peaks came a whistling wind, water
froze solid in all the pots and pans, earthenware jars and
bottles throughout the castle, save in the bowl which Amarabat,
shivering and miserable, wrapped in his haik and held close to
the embers, hearing the muezzin at each call to prayers; praying
himself to keep awake so that his fish might live.&nbsp; Dawn saw
him on the trail, the bowl wrapped in a woollen rag, and the fish
fed with bread-crumbs, but himself hungry and his head swimming
with want of sleep, with smoking &ldquo;kief,&rdquo; and with the
bitter wind which from El Tisi N&rsquo;Glaui flagellates the
road.&nbsp; Right through the valley of Teluet he still kept on,
and day and night still trotting, trotting on, changing his bowl
almost instinctively from hand to hand, a broad leaf floating on
the top to keep the water still, he left Agurzga, with its twin
castles, Ghresat and Dads, behind.&nbsp; Then rapidly descending,
in a day reached an oasis between Todghra and Ferkla, and rested
at a village for the night.&nbsp; Sheltered by palm-trees and
hedged round with cactuses and aloes, either to keep out thieves
or as a symbol of the thorniness of life, the village lay,
looking back on the white Atlas gaunt and mysterious, and on the
other side towards the brown Sahara, land of the palm-tree <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>(Belad-el-Jerid), the refuge of the true Ishmaelite;
for in the desert, learning, good faith, and hospitality can
still be found&mdash;at least, so Arabs say.</p>
<p>Orange and azofaifa trees, with almonds, sweet limes and
walnuts, stood up against the waning light, outlined in the clear
atmosphere almost so sharply as to wound the eye.&nbsp; Around
the well goats and sheep lay, whilst a girl led a camel round the
Noria track; women sat here and there and gossiped, with their
tall earthenware jars stuck by the point into the ground, and
waited for their turn, just as they did in the old times, so far
removed from us, but which in Arab life is but as yesterday, when
Jacob cheated Esau, and the whole scheme of Arab life was
photographed for us by the writers of the Pentateuch.&nbsp; In
fact, the self-same scene which has been acted every evening for
two thousand years throughout North Africa, since the adventurous
ancestors of the tribesmen of to-day left Hadrumut or Yemen, and
upon which Allah looks down approvingly, as recognizing that the
traditions of his first recorded life have been well kept.&nbsp;
Next day he trotted through the barren plain of Seddat, the Jibel
Saghra making a black line on the horizon to the south.&nbsp;
Here Berber tribes sweep in their razzias like hawks; but who
would plunder a rekass carrying a bowl of fish?&nbsp; Crossing
the dreary plain and dreaming of his entry into Tafilet, which
now was almost in his reach not two days distant, the sun beating
on his <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>head, the water almost boiling in the bowl, hungry and
footsore, and in the state betwixt waking and sleep into which
those who smoke hemp on journeys often get, he branched away upon
a trail leading towards the south.&nbsp; Between the oases of
Todghra and Ferkla, nothing but stone and sand, black stones on
yellow sand; sand, and yet more sand, and then again stretches of
blackish rocks with a suddra bush or two, and here and there a
colocynth, bitter and beautiful as love or life, smiling up at
the traveller from amongst the stones.&nbsp; Towards midday the
path led towards a sandy tract all overgrown with sandrac bushes
and crossed by trails of jackals and hyenas, then it quite
disappeared, and Amarabat waking from his dream saw he was
lost.&nbsp; Like a good shepherd, his first thought was for his
fish; for he imagined the last few hours of sun had made them
faint, and one of them looked heavy and swam sideways, and the
rest kept rising to the surface in an uneasy way.&nbsp; Not for a
moment was Amarabat frightened, but looked about for some known
landmark, and finding none started to go back on his trail.&nbsp;
But to his horror the wind which always sweeps across the Sahara
had covered up his tracks, and on the stony paths which he had
passed his feet had left no prints.&nbsp; Then Amarabat, the
first moments of despair passed by, took a long look at the
horizon, tightened his belt, pulled up his slipper heels, covered
his precious bowl with a corner of his robe, and started doggedly
back upon <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>the road he thought he traversed on the deceitful
path.&nbsp; How long he trotted, what he endured, whether the
fish died first, or if he drank, or, faithful to the last,
thirsting met death, no one can say.&nbsp; Most likely wandering
in the waste of sandhills and of suddra bushes he stumbled on,
smoking his hashish while it lasted, turning to Mecca at the time
of prayer, and trotting on more feebly (for he was born to run),
till he sat down beneath the sun-dried bushes where the Shinghiti
on his Mehari found him dead beside the trail.&nbsp; Under a
stunted sandarac tree, the head turned to the east, his body lay,
swollen and distorted by the pangs of thirst, the tongue
protruding rough as a parrot&rsquo;s, and beside him lay the
seven golden fish, once bright and shining as the pure gold when
the goldsmith pours it molten from his pot, but now turned black
and bloated, stiff, dry, and dead.&nbsp; Life the mysterious, the
mocking, the inscrutable, unseizable, the uncomprehended essence
of nothing and of everything, had fled, both from the faithful
messenger and from his fish.&nbsp; But the Khalifa&rsquo;s
parting caution had been well obeyed, for by the tree, unbroken,
the crystal bowl still glistened beautiful as gold, in the fierce
rays of the Saharan sun.</p>

HEGIRA</h2>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span><span
class="smcap">The</span> giant cypresses, tall even in the time
of Montezuma, the castle of Chapultepec upon its rock (an island
in the plain of Mexico), the panorama of the great city backed by
the mountain range; the two volcanoes, the Popocatepetl and the
Istacihuatl, and the lakes; the tigers in their cages, did not
interest me so much as a small courtyard, in which, ironed and
guarded, a band of Indians of the Apache tribe were kept
confined.&nbsp; Six warriors, a woman and a boy, captured close
to Chihuahua, and sent to Mexico, the Lord knows why; for
generally an Apache captured was shot at once, following the
frontier rule, which without difference of race was held on both
sides of the Rio Grande, that a good Indian must needs be
dead.</p>
<p>Silent and stoical the warriors sat, not speaking once in a
whole day, communicating but by signs; naked except the
breech-clout; their eyes apparently opaque, and looking at you
without sight, but seeing everything; and their demeanour less
reassuring than that of the tigers in the cage hard by.&nbsp; All
could speak Spanish if they liked, some a word or two of English,
but no one heard them <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>say a word in either tongue.&nbsp; I
asked the nearest if he was a Mescalero, and received the answer:
&ldquo;Mescalero-hay,&rdquo; and for a moment a gleam shone
through their eyes, but vanished instantly, as when the light
dies out of the wire in an electric lamp.&nbsp; The soldier at
the gate said they were &ldquo;brutes&rdquo;; all sons of dogs,
infidels, and that for his part he could not see why the
&ldquo;Gobierno&rdquo; went to the expense of keeping them
alive.&nbsp; He thought they had no sense; but in that showed his
own folly, and acted after the manner of the half-educated man
the whole world over, who knowing he can read and write thinks
that the savage who cannot do so is but a fool; being unaware
that, in the great book known as the world, the savage often is
the better scholar of the two.</p>
<p>But five-and-twenty years ago the Apache nation, split into
its chief divisions of Mescaleros, Jicarillas, Coyoteros, and
Lipanes, kept a great belt of territory almost five hundred miles
in length, and of about thirty miles in breadth, extending from
the bend of the Rio Gila to El Paso, in a perpetual war.&nbsp; On
both sides of the Rio Grande no man was safe; farms were
deserted, cattle carried off, villages built by the Spaniards,
and with substantial brick-built churches, mouldered into decay;
mines were unworkable, and horses left untended for a moment were
driven off in open day; so bold the thieves, that at one time
they had a settled month for plundering, which they called <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>openly the
Moon of the Mexicans, though they did not on that account suspend
their operations at other seasons of the year.&nbsp; Cochise and
Mangas-Coloradas, Naked Horse, Cuchillo Negro, and others of
their chiefs, were once far better known upon the frontiers than
the chief senators of the congresses of either of the two
republics; and in some instances these chiefs showed an
intelligence, knowledge of men and things, which in another
sphere would certainly have raised them high in the estimation of
mankind.</p>
<p>The Shis-Inday (the people of the woods), their guttural
language, with its curious monosyllable &ldquo;hay&rdquo; which
they tacked on to everything, as &ldquo;Oro-hay&rdquo; and
&ldquo;plata-hay&rdquo;; their strange democracy, each man being
chief of himself, and owning no allegiance to any one upon the
earth; all now have almost passed away, destroyed and swallowed
up by the &ldquo;Inday pindah lichoyi&rdquo; (the men of the
white eyes), as they used to call the Americans and all those
northerners who ventured into their territory to look for
&ldquo;yellow iron.&rdquo;&nbsp; I saw no more of the Apaches,
and except once, never again met any one of them; but as I left
the place the thought came to my mind, if any of them succeed in
getting out, I am certain that the six or seven hundred miles
between them and their country will be as nothing to them, and
that their journey thither will be marked with blood.</p>
<p>At Huehuetoca I joined the mule-train, doing <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>the twenty
miles which in those days was all the extent of railway in the
country to the north, and lost my pistol in a crowd just as I
stepped into the train, some &ldquo;lepero&rdquo; having
abstracted it out of my belt when I was occupied in helping five
strong men to get my horse into a cattle-truck.&nbsp; From
Huehuetoca we marched to Tula, and there camped for the night,
sleeping in a &ldquo;meson&rdquo; built like an Eastern fondak
round a court, and with a well for watering the beasts in the
centre of the yard.&nbsp; I strolled about the curious town, in
times gone by the Aztec capital, looked at the churches, built
like fortresses, and coming back to the &ldquo;meson&rdquo;
before I entered the cell-like room without a window, and with a
plaster bench on which to spread one&rsquo;s saddle and
one&rsquo;s rugs, I stopped to talk with a knot of travellers
feeding their animals on barley and chopped straw, grouped round
a fire, and the whole scene lit up and rendered Rembrandtesque by
the fierce glow of an &ldquo;ocote&rdquo; torch.&nbsp; So talking
of the Alps and Apennines, or, more correctly, speaking of the
Sierra Madre, and the mysterious region known as the Bolson de
Mapimi, a district in those days as little known as is the Sus
to-day, a traveller drew near.&nbsp; Checking his horse close by
the fire, and getting off it gingerly, for it was almost wild,
holding the hair &ldquo;mecate&rdquo; in his hand, he squatted
down, the horse snorting and hanging back, and setting rifle and
&ldquo;machete&rdquo; jingling upon the saddle, he began to
talk.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;Ave Maria purisima, had we heard the
news?&rdquo;&nbsp; What! a new revolution?&nbsp; Had Lerdo de
Tejada reappeared again? or had Cortinas made another raid on
Brownsville? the Indios Bravos harried Chihuahua? or had the
silver &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; coming from the mines been
robbed?&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing of this, but a voice ran (corria una
voz) that the Apache infidels confined in the courtyard of the
castle of Chapultepec had broken loose.&nbsp; Eight of them, six
warriors, a woman and a boy, had slipped their fetters, murdered
two of the guard, and were supposed to be somewhere not far from
Tula, and, as he thought, making for the Bolson de Mapimi, the
deserts of the Rio Gila, or the recesses of the mountains of the
Santa Rosa range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Needless to say this put all in the meson almost beside
themselves; for the terror that the Indians inspired was at that
time so real, that had the eight forlorn and helpless infidels
appeared I verily believe they would have killed us all.&nbsp;
Not that we were not brave, well armed&mdash;in fact, all loaded
down with arms, carrying rifles and pistols, swords stuck between
our saddle-girths, and generally so fortified as to resemble
walking arsenals.&nbsp; But valour is a thing of pure convention,
and these men who would have fought like lions against marauders
of their own race, scarce slept that night for thinking on the
dangers which they ran by the reported presence of those six
naked men.&nbsp; The night passed by without alarm, as was to be
expected, seeing <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>that the courtyard wall of the meson was at least ten
feet high, and the gate solid &ldquo;ahuehuete&rdquo; clamped
with iron, and padlocked like a jail.&nbsp; At the first dawn, or
rather at the first false dawn, when the fallacious streaks of
pink flash in the sky and fade again to night, all were
afoot.&nbsp; Horsemen rode out, sitting erect in their peaked
saddles, toes stuck out and thrust into their curiously stamped
toe-leathers; their &ldquo;chaparreras&rdquo; giving to their
legs a look of being cased in armour, their &ldquo;poblano&rdquo;
hats, with bands of silver or of tinsel, balanced like halos on
their heads.</p>
<p>Long trains of donkeys, driven by Indians dressed in leather,
and bareheaded, after the fashion of their ancestors, crawled
through the gate laden with &ldquo;pulque,&rdquo; and now and
then a single Indian followed by his wife set off on foot,
carrying a crate of earthenware by a broad strap depending from
his head.&nbsp; Our caravan, consisting of six two-wheeled
mule-carts, drawn by a team of six or sometimes eight
gaily-harnessed mules, and covered with a tilt made from the
&ldquo;istle,&rdquo; creaked through the gate.&nbsp; The great
meson remained deserted, and by degrees, as a ship leaves the
coast, we struck into the wild and stony desert country, which,
covered with a whitish dust of alkali, makes Tula an oasis; then
the great church sank low, and the tall palm-trees seemed to grow
shorter; lastly church, palms and towers, and the green fields
planted with aloes, blended together and <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>sank out of
sight, a faint white misty spot marking their whereabouts, till
at last it too faded and melted into the level plain.</p>
<p>Travellers in a perpetual stream we met journeying to Mexico,
and every now and then passed a straw-thatched
&ldquo;jacal,&rdquo; where women sat selling &ldquo;atole,&rdquo;
that is a kind of stirabout of pine-nut meal and milk, and dishes
seasoned hot with red pepper, with &ldquo;tortillas&rdquo; made
on the &ldquo;metate&rdquo; of the Aztecs, to serve as bread and
spoons.&nbsp; The infidels, it seemed, had got ahead of us, and
when we slept had been descried making towards the north; two of
them armed with bows which they had roughly made with sticks, the
string twisted out of &ldquo;istle,&rdquo; and the rest with
clubs, and what astonished me most was that behind them trotted a
white dog.&nbsp; Outside San Juan del Rio, which we reached upon
the second day, it seemed that in the night the homing Mescaleros
had stolen a horse, and two of them mounting upon him had ridden
off, leaving the rest of the forlorn and miserable band
behind.&nbsp; How they had lived so far in the scorched
alkali-covered plains, how they managed to conceal themselves by
day, or how they steered by night, no one could tell; for the
interior Mexican knows nothing of the desert craft, and has no
idea that there is always food of some kind for an Apache, either
by digging roots, snaring small animals, or at the last resort by
catching locusts or any other insect he can find.&nbsp; Nothing
so easy as to conceal <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>themselves; for amongst grass eight
or nine inches high, they drop, and in an instant, even as you
look, are lost to sight, and if hard pressed sometimes escape
attention by standing in a cactus grove, and stretching out their
arms, look so exactly like the plant that you may pass close to
them and be unaware, till their bow twangs, and an
obsidian-headed arrow whistles through the air.</p>
<p>Our caravan rested a day outside San Juan del Rio to shoe the
mules, repair the harness, and for the muleteers to go to mass or
visit the &ldquo;poblana&rdquo; girls, who with flowers in their
hair leaned out of every balcony of the half-Spanish,
half-Oriental-looking town, according to their taste.&nbsp; Not
that the halt lost time, for travellers all know that &ldquo;to
hear mass and to give barley to your beasts loses no tittle of
the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>San Juan, the river almost dry, and trickling thirstily under
its red stone bridges; the fields of aloes, the poplars, and the
stunted palms; its winding street in which the houses,
overhanging, almost touch; its population, which seemed to pass
their time lounging wrapped in striped blankets up against the
walls, was left behind.&nbsp; The pulque-aloes and the
sugar-canes grew scarcer, the road more desolate as we emerged
into the &ldquo;terra fria&rdquo; of the central plain, and all
the time the Sierra Madre, jagged and menacing, towered in the
west.&nbsp; In my mind&rsquo;s eye I saw the Mescaleros trotting
like wolves all through the night along its base, <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>sleeping by
day in holes, killing a sheep or goat when chance occurred, and
following one another silent and stoical in their tramp towards
the north.</p>
<p>Days followed days as in a ship at sea; the waggons rolling on
across the plains; and I jogging upon my horse, half sleeping in
the sun, or stretched at night half dozing on a tilt, almost lost
count of time.&nbsp; Somewhere between San Juan del Rio and San
Luis Potosi we learned two of the Indians had been killed, but
that the four remaining were still pushing onward, and in a
little while we met a body of armed men carrying two ghastly
heads tied by their scalp-locks to the saddle-bow.&nbsp; Much did
the slayers vaunt their prowess; telling how in a wood at break
of day they had fallen in with all the Indians seated round a
fire, and that whilst the rest fled, two had sprung on them, as
they said, &ldquo;after the fashion of wild beasts, armed one
with a stick, and the other with a stone, and by God&rsquo;s
grace,&rdquo; and here the leader crossed himself, &ldquo;their
aim had been successful, and the two sons of dogs had fallen, but
most unfortunately the rest during the fight had managed to
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>San Luis Potosi, the rainless city, once world-renowned for
wealth, and even now full of fine buildings, churches and
palaces, and with a swarming population of white-clothed Indians
squatting to sell their trumpery in the great market-square,
loomed up amongst its fringe of gardens, irrigated lands, its
groves of pepper-trees, its palms, its <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>wealth of
flowering shrubs; its great white domes, giving an air of Bagdad
or of Fez, shone in the distance, then grew nearer, and at last
swallowed us up, as wearily we passed through the outskirts of
the town, and halted underneath the walls.</p>
<p>The city, then an oasis in the vast plateau of An&aacute;huac
(now but a station on a railway-line), a city of enormous
distances, of gurgling water led in stucco channels by the side
of every street, of long expanses of &ldquo;adobe&rdquo; walls,
of immense plazas, of churches and of bells, of countless
convents; hedged in by mountains to the west, mouth of the
&ldquo;tierra caliente&rdquo; to the east, and to the north the
stopping-place for the long trains of waggons carrying cotton
from the States; wrapped in a mist as of the Middle Ages, lay
sleeping in the sun.&nbsp; On every side the plain lapped like an
ocean, and the green vegetation round the town stopped so
abruptly that you could step almost at once from fertile meadows
into a waste of whitish alkali.</p>
<p>Above the town, in a foothill of the Sierra Madre about three
leagues away, is situated the &ldquo;Enchanted City,&rdquo; never
yet fouled by the foot of man, but yet existent, and believed in
by all those who follow that best part of history, the traditions
which have come down to us from the times when men were wise, and
when imagination governed judgment, as it should do to-day, being
the noblest faculty of the human mind.&nbsp; Either want of time,
or that belittling education from which few can <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>escape,
prevented me from visiting the place.&nbsp; Yet I still think if
rightly sought the city will be found, and I feel sure the
Mescaleros passed the night not far from it, and perhaps looking
down upon San Luis Potosi cursed it, after the fashion that the
animals may curse mankind for its injustice to them.</p>
<p>Tired of its squares, its long dark streets, its hum of
people; and possessed perhaps with that nostalgia of the desert
which comes so soon to all who once have felt its charm when
cooped in bricks, we set our faces northward about an hour before
the day, passed through the gates and rolled into the
plains.&nbsp; The mules well rested shook their bells, the
leagues soon dropped behind, the muleteers singing &ldquo;La
Pasadita,&rdquo; or an interminable song about a
&ldquo;Gachupin&rdquo; <a name="citation131"></a><a
href="#footnote131" class="citation">[131]</a> who loved a
nun.</p>
<p>The Mescaleros had escaped our thoughts&mdash;that is, the
muleteers thought nothing of them; but I followed their every
step, saw them crouched round their little fire, roasting the
roots of wild &ldquo;mescal&rdquo;; marked them upon the march in
single file, their eyes fixed on the plain, watchful and silent
as they were phantoms gliding to the north.</p>
<p>Crossing a sandy tract, the Capataz, who had long lived in the
&ldquo;Pimeria Alta,&rdquo; and amongst the Maricopas on the
Gila, drew up his horse and <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>pointing to the ground said,
&ldquo;Viva Mexico!&mdash;look at these footmarks in the
sand.&nbsp; They are the infidels; see where the men have trod;
here is the woman&rsquo;s print and this the boy&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Look how their toes are all turned in, unlike the tracks of
Christians.&nbsp; This trail is a day old, and yet how
fresh!&nbsp; See where the boy has stumbled&mdash;thanks to the
Blessed Virgin they must all be tired, and praise to God will die
upon the road, either by hunger or some Christian
hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; All that he spoke of was no doubt visible to
him, but through my want of faith, or perhaps lack of experience,
I saw but a faint trace of naked footsteps in the sand.&nbsp;
Such as they were, they seemed the shadow of a ghost, unstable
and unreal, and struck me after the fashion that it strikes one
when a man holds up a cane and tells you gravely, without a
glimmering of the strangeness of the fact, that it came from
Japan, actually grew there, and had leaves and roots, and was as
little thought of as a mere ash-plant growing in a copse.</p>
<p>At an &ldquo;hacienda&rdquo; upon the road, just where the
trail leads off upon one hand to Matehuala, and on the other to
Rio Verde, and the hot countries of the coast, we stopped to pass
the hottest hours in sleep.&nbsp; All was excitement; men came
in, their horses flecked with foam; others were mounting, and all
armed to the teeth, as if the Yankees had crossed the Rio Grande,
and were marching on the place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Los Indios! si,
se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; they had been <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>seen, only last night, but such the
valour of the people of the place, they had passed on doing no
further damage than to kill a lamb.&nbsp; No chance of sleep in
such a turmoil of alarm; each man had his own plan, all talked at
once, most of them were half drunk, and when our Capataz asked
dryly if they had thought of following the trail, a silence fell
on all.&nbsp; By this time, owing to the horsemen galloping
about, the trail was cut on every side, and to have followed it
would have tried the skill of an Apache tracker; but just then
upon the plain a cloud of dust was seen.&nbsp; Nearer it came,
and then out of the midst of it horses appeared, arms flashed,
and when nearing the place five or six men galloped up to the
walls, and stopped their horses with a jerk.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
news? have you seen anything of the Apaches?&rdquo; and the chief
rider of the gallant band, getting off slowly, and fastening up
his horse, said, with an air of dignity, &ldquo;At the
&lsquo;encrucijada,&rsquo; four leagues along the road, you will
find one of them.&nbsp; We came upon him sitting on a stone, too
tired to move, called on him to surrender, but Indians have no
sense, so he came at us tired as he was, and we, being valiant,
fired, and he fell dead.&nbsp; Then, that the law should be made
manifest to all, we hung his body by the feet to a
huisach&eacute; tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then compliments broke out and
&ldquo;Viva los valientes!&rdquo; &ldquo;Viva Mexico!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mueran los Indios salvajes!&rdquo; and much of the same
sort, whilst the five valiant men modestly took a drink, saying
<a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>but
little, for true courage does not show itself in talk.</p>
<p>Leaving the noisy crew drinking confusion to their enemies, we
rolled into the plain.&nbsp; Four dusty leagues, and the
huisach&eacute; tree growing by four cross trails came into
sight.&nbsp; We neared it, and to a branch, naked except his
breech-clout, covered with bullet-wounds, we saw the Indian
hang.&nbsp; Half-starved he looked, and so reduced that from the
bullet-holes but little blood had run; his feet were bloody, and
his face hanging an inch or two above the ground distorted; flies
buzzed about him, and in the sky a faint black line on the
horizon showed that the vultures had already scented food.</p>
<p>We left the nameless warrior hanging on his tree, and took our
way across the plain, well pleased both with the
&ldquo;valour&rdquo; of his slayers and the position of affairs
in general in the world at large.&nbsp; Right up and down the Rio
Grande on both sides for almost a thousand miles the lonely cross
upon some river-side, near to some thicket, or out in the wide
plain, most generally is lettered &ldquo;Killed by the
Apaches,&rdquo; and in the game they played so long, and still
held trumps in at the time I write of, they, too, paid for all
errors, in their play, by death.&nbsp; But still it seemed a
pity, savage as they were, that so much cunning, such stoical
indifference to both death and life, should always finish as the
warrior whom I saw hang by the feet from the <a

135</span>huisach&eacute;, just where the road to Matehuala
bifurcates, and the trail breaks off to El Jarral.&nbsp; And so
we took our road, passed La Parida, Matehuala, El Catorce, and
still the sterile plateau spread out like a vast sea, the sparse
and stunted bushes in the constant mirage looming at times like
trees, at others seeming just to float above the sand; and as we
rolled along, the mules struggling and straining in the whitish
dust, we seemed to lose all trace of the Apaches; and at the lone
hacienda or rare villages no one had heard of them, and the
mysterious hegira of the party, now reduced to three, left no
more traces of its passing than water which has closed upon the
passage of a fish.</p>
<p>Gomez Farias, Parras, El Llano de la Guerra, we passed
alternately, and at length Saltillo came in sight, its towers
standing up upon the plain after the fashion of a lighthouse in
the sea; the bull-ring built under the Viceroys looking like a
fort; and then the plateau of An&aacute;huac finished abruptly,
and from the ramparts of the willow-shaded town the great green
plains stretched out towards Texas in a vast panorama; whilst
upon the west in the dim distance frowned the serrated mountains
of Santa Rosa, and further still the impenetrable fastnesses of
the Bolson de Mapimi.</p>
<p>Next day we took the road for Monterey, descending in a day by
the rough path known as &ldquo;la cuesta de los fierros,&rdquo;
from the cold plateau to a land of palms, of cultivation,
orange-groves, of <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>fruit-trees, olive-gardens, a balmy air filled with the
noise of running waters; and passing underneath the Cerro de la
Silla which dominates the town, slept peacefully far from all
thoughts of Indians and of perils of the road, in the great
caravansary which at that time was the chief glory of the town of
Monterey.&nbsp; The city with its shady streets, its alameda
planted with palm-trees, and its plaza all decorated with
stuccoed plaster seats painted pale pink, and upon which during
both day and night half of the population seemed to lounge, lay
baking in the sun.</p>
<p>Great teams of waggons driven by Texans creaked through the
streets, the drivers dressed in a &ldquo;d&eacute;froque&rdquo;
of old town clothes, often a worn frock-coat and rusty trousers
stuffed into cowboy boots, the whole crowned with an ignominious
battered hat, and looking, as the Mexicans observed, like
&ldquo;pantomimas, que salen en las fiestas.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mexicans from down the coast, from Tamaulipas, Tuxpan, Vera Cruz
and Guatzecoalcos ambled along on horses all ablaze with silver;
and to complete the picture, a tribe of Indians, the Kickopoos,
who had migrated from the north, and who occasionally rode
through the town in single file, their rifles in their hands, and
looking at the shops half longingly, half frightened, passed
along without a word.</p>
<p>But all the varied peoples, the curious half-wild,
half-patriarchal life, the fruits and flowers, the <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>strangeness
of the place, could not divert my thoughts from the three lone
pathetic figures, followed by their dog, which in my mind&rsquo;s
eye I saw making northward, as a wild goose finds its path in
spring, leaving no traces of its passage by the way.&nbsp; I
wondered what they thought of, how they looked upon the world, if
they respected all they saw of civilized communities upon their
way, or whether they pursued their journey like a horse let loose
returning to his birthplace, anxious alone about arriving at the
goal.&nbsp; So Monterey became a memory; the Cerro de la Silla
last vanishing, when full five leagues upon the road.&nbsp; The
dusty plains all white with alkali, the grey-green sage-bushes,
the salt and crystal-looking rivers, the Indians bending under
burdens, and the women sitting at the cross roads selling
tortillas&mdash;all now had changed.&nbsp; Through oceans of tall
grass, by muddy rivers in which alligators basked, by
&ldquo;bayous,&rdquo; &ldquo;resacas,&rdquo; and by
&ldquo;bottoms&rdquo; of alluvial soil, in which grew
cotton-woods, black-jack, and post-oak, with gigantic willows;
through countless herds of half-wild horses, lighting the
landscape with their colours, and through a rolling prairie with
vast horizons bounded by faint blue mountain chains, we took our
way.&nbsp; Out of the thickets of &ldquo;mezquite&rdquo; wild
boars peered upon the path; rattlesnakes sounded their note of
warning or lay basking in the sun; at times an antelope bounded
across our track, and the rare villages were fortified <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>with high
mud walls, had gates, and sometimes drawbridges, for all the
country we were passing through was subject to invasions of
&ldquo;los Indios Bravos,&rdquo; and no one rode a mile without
the chance of an attack.&nbsp; When travellers met they zigzagged
to and fro like battleships in the old days striving to get the
&ldquo;weather gauge,&rdquo; holding their horses tightly by the
head, and interchanging salutations fifty yards away, though if
they happened to be Texans and Mexicans they only glared, or
perhaps yelled an obscenity at one another in their different
tongues.&nbsp; Advertisements upon the trees informed the
traveller that the place to stop at was the &ldquo;Old Buffalo
Camp&rdquo; in San Antonio, setting forth its whisky, its perfect
safety both for man and beast, and adding curtly it was only a
short four hundred miles away.&nbsp; Here for the first time in
our journey we sent out a rider about half-a-mile ahead to scan
the route, ascend the little hills, keep a sharp eye on
&ldquo;Indian sign,&rdquo; and give us warning by a timely shot,
all to dismount, &ldquo;corral&rdquo; the waggons, and be
prepared for an attack of Indians, or of the roaming bands of
rascals who like pirates wandered on the plains.&nbsp; Dust made
us anxious, and smoke ascending in the distance set us all
wondering if it was Indians, or a shepherd&rsquo;s fire; at
halting time no one strayed far from camp, and we sat eating with
our rifles by our sides, whilst men on horseback rode round the
mules, keeping them well in sight, as shepherds watch their
sheep.&nbsp; <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>About two leagues from Juarez a traveller bloody with
spurring passed us carrying something in his hand; he stopped and
held out a long arrow with an obsidian head, painted in various
colours, and feathered in a peculiar way.&nbsp; A consultation
found it to be &ldquo;Apache,&rdquo; and the man galloped on to
take it to the governor of the place to tell him Indians were
about, or, as he shouted (following the old Spanish catchword),
&ldquo;there were Moors upon the coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juarez we slept at, quite secure within the walls; started at
daybreak, crossing the swiftly-running river just outside the
town, at the first streak of light; journeyed all day, still
hearing nothing of the retreating Mescaleros, and before evening
reached Las Navas, which we found astir, all lighted up, and
knots of people talking excitedly, whilst in the plaza the whole
population seemed to be afoot.&nbsp; At the long wooden tables
set about with lights, where in a Mexican town at sundown an al
fresco meal of kid stewed in red pepper, &ldquo;tamales&rdquo;
and &ldquo;tortillas,&rdquo; is always laid, the talk was
furious, and each man gave his opinion at the same time, after
the fashion of the Russian Mir, or as it may be that we shall yet
see done during debates in Parliament, so that all men may have a
chance to speak, and yet escape the ignominy of their words being
caught, set down, and used against them, after the present
plan.&nbsp; The Mescaleros had been seen passing about a league
outside <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>the town.&nbsp; A shepherd lying hidden, watching his
sheep, armed with a rifle, had spied them, and reported that they
had passed close to him; the woman coming last and carrying in
her arms a little dog; and he &ldquo;thanked God and all His holy
saints who had miraculously preserved his life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After the shepherd&rsquo;s story, in the afternoon firing had
been distinctly heard towards the small rancho of Las Crucecitas,
which lay about three leagues further on upon the road.&nbsp; All
night the din of talk went on, and in the morning when we started
on our way, full half the population went with us to the gate,
all giving good advice; to keep a good look-out, if we saw dust
to be certain it was Indians driving the horses stolen from Las
Crucecitas, then to get off at once, corral the waggons, and
above all to put our trust in God.&nbsp; This we agreed to do,
but wondered why out of so many valiant men not one of them
proffered assistance, or volunteered to mount his horse and ride
with us along the dangerous way.</p>
<p>The road led upwards towards some foothills, set about with
scrubby palms; not fifteen miles away rose the dark mountains of
the Santa Rosa chain, and on a little hill the rancho stood,
flat-roofed and white, and seemingly not more than a short league
away, so clear the light, and so immense the scale of everything
upon the rolling plain.&nbsp; I knew that in the mountains the
three Indians were safe, as the whole range was Indian territory;
and as I <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>saw them struggling up the slopes, the little dog
following them footsore, hanging down its head, or carried as the
shepherd said in the &ldquo;she-devil&rsquo;s&rdquo; arms, I
wished them luck after their hegira, planned with such courage,
carried out so well, had ended, and they were back again amongst
the tribe.</p>
<p>Just outside Crucecitas we met a Texan who, as he told us,
owned the place, and lived in &ldquo;kornkewbinage with a native
gal,&rdquo; called, as he said, &ldquo;Pastory,&rdquo; who it
appeared of all the females he had ever met was the best hand to
bake &ldquo;tortillers,&rdquo; and whom, had she not been a
Catholic, he would have made his wife.&nbsp; All this without a
question on our part, and sitting sideways on his horse, scanning
the country from the corner of his eye.&nbsp; He told us that he
had &ldquo;had right smart of an Indian trouble here yesterday
just about afternoon.&nbsp; Me and my &lsquo;vaquerys&rsquo; were
around looking for an estray horse, just six of us, when close to
the ranch we popped kermash right upon three red devils, and
opened fire at once.&nbsp; I hed a Winchester, and at the first
fire tumbled the buck; he fell right in his tracks, and jest as I
was taking off his scalp, I&rsquo;m doggoned if the squaw and the
young devil didn&rsquo;t come at us jest like grizzly bars.&nbsp;
Wal, yes, killed &rsquo;em, o&rsquo; course, and anyhow the young
&rsquo;un would have growed up; but the squaw I&rsquo;me sort of
sorry about.&nbsp; I never could bear to kill a <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>squaw,
though I&rsquo;ve often seen it done.&nbsp; Naow here&rsquo;s the
all-firedest thing yer ever heard; jes&rsquo; as I was turning
the bodies over with my foot a little Indian dog flies at us like
a &lsquo;painter,&rsquo; the varmint, the condemndest little
buffler I ever struck.&nbsp; I was for shootin&rsquo; him, but
&lsquo;Pastory&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s my
&lsquo;kornkewbyne&rsquo;&mdash;she up and says it was a
shame.&nbsp; Wal, we had to bury them, for dead Injun stinks
worst than turkey-buzzard, and the dodgasted little dog is
sitting on the grave, &rsquo;pears like he&rsquo;s froze,
leastwise he hastn&rsquo;t moved since sun-up, when we planted
the whole crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under a palm-tree not far from the house the Indians&rsquo;
grave was dug, upon it, wretched and draggled, sat the little
dog.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pastory&rdquo; tried to catch it all day long,
being kind-hearted though a &ldquo;kornkewbyne&rdquo;; but,
failing, said &ldquo;God was not willing,&rdquo; and retired into
the house.&nbsp; The hours seemed days in the accursed place till
the sun rose, gilding the unreached Santa Rosa mountains, and
bringing joy into the world.&nbsp; We harnessed up the mules, and
started silently out on the lonely road; turning, I checked my
horse, and began moralizing on all kinds of things; upon tenacity
of purpose, the futility of life, and the inexorable fate which
mocks mankind, making all effort useless, whilst still urging us
to strive.&nbsp; Then the grass rustled, and across an open space
a small white object trotted, looking furtively around, threw <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>up its head
and howled, ran to and fro as if it sought for something, howled
dismally again, and after scratching in the ground, squatted
dejectedly on the fresh-turned-up earth which marked the
Indians&rsquo; grave.</p>

<p><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span><span
class="smcap">Religious</span> persecution with isolation from
the world, complete as if the Lebanon were an atoll island in the
Paumotus group; a thousand years of slavery, and centuries
innumerable of traditions of a proud past, the whole well
filtered through the curriculum of an American missionary
college, had made Maron Mohanna the strange compound that he
was.&nbsp; Summer and winter dressed in a greasy black
frock-coat, hat tilted on his head, as if it had been a fez;
dilapidated white-topped mother-of-pearl bebuttoned boots, a
shirt which seemed to come as dirty from the wash as it went
there; his shoulders sloping and his back bent in a perpetual
squirm, Mohanna shuffled through the world with the exterior of a
pimp, but yet with certain aspirations towards a wild life which
seldom are entirely absent from any member of the Arab
race.&nbsp; So in his village of the Lebanon he grew to
man&rsquo;s estate, and drifted after the fashion of his
countrymen into a precarious business in the East.&nbsp; Half
proxenete, half dragoman, servile to all above him and civil for
prudence&rsquo; sake to all below, he passed through the various
degrees of hotel tout, seller of <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>cigarettes, and guide to the
antiquities of whatever town he happened to reside in, to the
full glory of a shop in which he sold embroideries, attar of
roses, embroidered slippers and all the varied trash which
tourists buy in the bazaars of the Levant.&nbsp; But all the
time, and whilst he studied French and English with a view to
self-advancement, the ancient glories of the Arab race were
always in his mind.&nbsp; Himself a Christian of the Christians,
reared in that hotbed of theology the Lebanon, where all the
creeds mutually show their hatred of each other, and display
themselves in their most odious aspects; and whilst hating the
Mohammedans as a first principle of his belief, he found himself
mysteriously attracted to their creed.&nbsp; Not that his reason
was seduced by the teachings of the Koran, but that somehow the
stately folly of the whole scheme of life evolved by the
ex-camel-driver appealed to him, as it has oftentimes appealed to
stronger minds than his.&nbsp; The call to prayers, the
half-contemplative, half-militant existence led by Mohammedans;
the immense simplicity of their hegemony; the idea of a not
impossible one God, beyond men&rsquo;s ken, looking down frostily
through the stars upon the plains, a Being to be evoked without
much hope of being influenced, took hold of him and set him
thinking whether all members of the Arab race ought not to hold
one faith.&nbsp; And in addition to his speculations upon faith
and race, vaguely at times it crossed his mind, as I <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>believe it
often crosses the minds of almost every Arab (and Syrians not a
few), &ldquo;If all else fail, I can retire into the desert, join
the tribes and pass a pleasant life, sure of a wife or two, a
horse, a lance, a long flint gun, a bowl of camel&rsquo;s milk,
and a black tent in which to rest at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little indeed are the chances of a young educated Syrian to
make his living in the Lebanon.&nbsp; A certain modicum of the
young men is always absorbed into the ranks of the various true
faiths which send out missionaries to convert Arab-speaking
races, and those so absorbed generally pass their lives preaching
shamefacedly that which they partially believe, to those whose
faith is fixed.&nbsp; Others again gravitate naturally to Cairo
to seek for Government employment, or to write in the Arabic
press, taking sides for England or for France, as the editors of
the opposing papers make it worth their while.&nbsp; But the
great bulk of the intellectual Syrian proletariat emigrates to
New York and there lives in a quarter by itself, engaging in all
kinds of little industries, dealing in Oriental curiosities, or
publishing newspapers in the Arab tongue.&nbsp; There they pass
much of their time lounging at their shop-doors with slippers
down at heel, in smoking cigarettes, in drinking arrack, and in
speculating when their native country shall be free.</p>
<p>To none of these well-recognized careers did Maron Mohanna
feel himself impelled.&nbsp; Soon tiring of his shop he went to
Egypt, worked on a <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>newspaper, and then became a teacher of Arabic to
Europeans; was taken by one of them to London, where he passed
some years earning a threadbare livelihood by translating Arabic
documents and writing for the press.&nbsp; When out of work he
tramped about the streets to cheat his hunger, and if in funds
frequented music-halls, and lavished his hard-earned money on the
houris who frequent such places, describing them as &ldquo;fine
and tall, too fond of drink, and perhaps colder in the blood than
are the women of the East.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not often did his
fortunes permit him such extravagances, and he began to pass his
life hanging about the City in the wake of the impossible gang of
small company-promoters, who in the purlieus of the financial
world weave shoddy Utopias, and are the cause of much vain labour
to postmen and some annoyance to the public, but who as far as I
can see live chiefly upon hope deferred, for their prospectuses
seem to be generally cast into the basket, from which no share
list ever has returned.&nbsp; But in the darkest of poor Maron
Mohanna&rsquo;s blackest days, his dreams about the Arab race
never forsook him, and he studied much to master all the
subtleties of his native tongue, talking with Arabs, Easterns,
Persians, and the like in the lunch-room of the British Museum,
where scholars of all nations, blear-eyed and bent, eat sawdust
sandwiches and drink lemonade, whilst wearing out their eyes and
lives for pittances which a dock labourer would <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>turn from
in disgust.&nbsp; Much did the shivering Easterns confabulate,
much did they talk of grammar, of niceties of diction, much did
they dispute, often they talked of women, sometimes of horses,
for on both all Easterns, no matter how they pass their lives,
have much to say, and what they say is often worth attention, for
in both matters their ancestors were learned when ours rode
shaggy ponies, and their one miserable wife wrestled with fifteen
fair-haired children in the damp forests where the Briton was
evolved.&nbsp; How long Maron Mohanna dwelt in London is matter
of uncertainty, to what abyss of poverty he fell, or if in the
worst times he tramped the Embankment, sleeping on a bench and
dreaming ever of the future of the Arab race, is not set
down.&nbsp; The next act of his life finds him the trusted
manager of the West African Company at Cape Juby.&nbsp; There he
enjoyed a salary duly paid every quarter, and was treated with
much deference by the employees as being the only man the company
employed who could speak Arabic.&nbsp; Report avers he had
embraced either the Wesleyan or the Baptist faith, as the chief
shareholders of the affair were Nonconformists, whose ancestors
having (as they alleged) enjoyed much persecution for their
faith, were well resolved that every one who came within their
power should outwardly, at least, conform to their own tenets in
dogma and church government.</p>
<p>Established at Cape Juby, Maron Mohanna for <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>the first
time enjoyed consideration, and for a while the world went well
with him.&nbsp; He duly wrote reports, inspected goods, watched
the arrival of the <i>Sahara</i>, the schooner which came once a
month from Lanzarote, and generally endeavoured to discharge the
duties of a manager, with some success.&nbsp; The chiefs
Mohammed-wold-el-Biruc and Bu-Dabous, with others from the
far-distant districts of El Juf, El Hodh, and from Tishit, all
flattered him, offering him women from their various tribes and
telling him that he too was of their blood.&nbsp; So by degrees
either the affinity of race, the community of language or the
provoking commonness of his European comrades, drew him to seek
his most congenial friends amongst the natives of the
place.&nbsp; Then came the woman: the woman who always creeps
into the life of man as the snake crept into the garden by the
Euphrates; and Mohanna knowing that by so doing he forfeited all
chance of his career, gave up his post, married an Arab girl, and
became a desert Arab, living on dates and camel&rsquo;s milk in
the black Bedouin tents.&nbsp; Children he had, to whom, though
desert-born, he gave the names of Christians, feeling perhaps the
nostalgia of civilization in the wilds, as he had felt before the
nostalgia of the desert, in his blood.&nbsp; And living in the
desert with his hair grown long, dressed in the blue
&ldquo;baft&rdquo; clothes, a spear in his hand and shod with
sandals, he yet looked like a European clerk in masquerade.</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>The
bushy plains stretched like an ocean towards the mysterious
regions of El Juf and Timbuctoo, Wadan, Tijigja, Atar and
Shingiet, and the wild steppes where the Tuaregs veiled to the
eyes roam as they roamed before they hastened to the call of
Jusuf-ibn Tachfin to invade El Andalos and lose the battle at Las
Navas de Tolosa: the battle where San Isidro in a
shepherd&rsquo;s guise guided the Christian host.&nbsp; Men came
and went, on camels, horses, donkeys and on foot; all armed, all
beggars, from the rich chief to the poorest horseman of the
tribe; and yet all dignified, draped in their fluttering rags,
and looking more like men than those whom eighteen centuries of
civilization and of trade have turned to apes.&nbsp; Men fought,
careering on their horses on the sand, firing their guns and
circling round like gulls, shouting their battle-cries; men
prayed, turning to Mecca at the appointed hours; men sat for
hours half in a dream thinking of much or nothing, who can say;
whilst women in the tents milked camels, wove the curious
geometric-patterned carpets which they use, and children grew up
straight, active and as fleet of foot as roe.</p>
<p>Inside the factory the European clerks smoked, drank, and
played at cards: they learned no Arabic, for why should those who
speak bad English struggle with other tongues?&nbsp; Meanwhile
the time slipped past, leaving as little trace as does a jackal
when on a windy day he sneaks across the sand.&nbsp; Only Maron
Mohanna seemed to have no place in the <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>desert
world which he had dreamed of as a boy; and in the world of
Europe typified by the factory on the beach his place was
lost.&nbsp; On marrying he had, of course, abjured the faith
implanted in him in the Lebanon, and yet though now one of the
&ldquo;faithful&rdquo; he found no resting-place.&nbsp; Neither
of the two contending faiths had sunk much into his soul, but
still at times he saw that the best part of any faith is but the
life it brings.&nbsp; For him, though he had dreamed of it, the
wild desert life held little charm; horses he loathed, suffering
acutely when on their backs, and roaming after chance gazelles or
ostriches with the horsemen of the tribe did not amuse him; but
though too proud to change his faith again, at times he caught
himself longing for his once-loathed shop in the Levant.&nbsp; So
that clandestinely he grew to haunt the factory and the fort, as
before, in secret, he had hung round the straw-thatched mosque,
and loitered in the tents.&nbsp; His one amusement was to
practise with a pistol at a mark, and by degrees he taught his
wife to shoot, till she became a marksman able to throw an orange
in the air and hit it with a pistol bullet three times out of
five.&nbsp; But even pistol-shooting palled on his soul at last,
and he grew desperate, not being allowed to leave the tribe or go
into the fort except in company with others, and keenly watched
as those who change their faith and turn Mohammedans are ever
watched amongst the Arab race.&nbsp; But in his darkest hour fate
smiled upon him, and <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>the head chief wanting an agent in
the islands sent him to Lanzarote, and in the little town of
Arrecife it seemed to him that he had found a resting-place at
last.&nbsp; Once more he dressed himself in European clothes, he
handled goods, saw now and then a Spanish newspaper a fortnight
old; talked much of politics, lounged in the Alameda, and was the
subject of much curiosity amongst the simple dwellers in the
little town.&nbsp; Some said he had denied his God amongst the
heathen; others again that he suffered much for conscience&rsquo;
sake; whilst he attended mass occasionally, going with a sense of
doing something wrong, and feeling more enjoyment in the service
than in the days of his belief.&nbsp; His wife dressed in the
Spanish fashion, wore a mantilla, sometimes indeed a hat, and
looked not much unlike an island woman, and was believed by all
to have thrown off the errors of her faith and come into the
fold.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding all the amenities of the island life, the
unlimited opportunities for endless talk (so dear to Syrians),
the half-malignant pleasure he experienced in dressing up his
wife in Christian guise, sending for monstrous hats bedecked with
paroquets from Cadiz, and gowns of the impossible shades of
apple-green and yellow which in those days were sent from Paris
to Spain and to her colonies, he yet was dull.&nbsp; And
curiously enough, now that he was a double renegade his youthful
dreams haunted him once again.&nbsp; He saw himself <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>(in his
mind&rsquo;s eye) mounted upon his horse, flying across the
sands, and stealthily and half ashamed he used to dress himself
in the Arab clothes and sit for hours studying the Koran, not
that he believed its teachings, but that the phraseology
enchanted him, as it has always, both in the present and the
past, bewitched all Arabs, and perhaps in his case it spoke to
him of the illusory content which in the desert life he sought,
but had not found.</p>
<p>He read the &ldquo;Tarik-es-Sudan,&rdquo; and learned that
Allah marks even the lives of locusts, and that a single pearl
does not remain on earth by him unweighed.&nbsp; The Djana of
Essoyuti, El Ibtihaj, and the scarce &ldquo;Choice of
Marvels&rdquo; written in far Mossul by the learned Abu Abdallah
ibn Abderrahim (he of Granada in the Andalos), he read; and as he
read his love renewed itself for the old race whose blood ran in
his veins.&nbsp; He read and dreamed, and twice a renegade in
practice, yet remained a true believer in the aspirations of his
youth.&nbsp; He sailed in schooners, running from island port to
island port down the trade winds; landed at little towns, and
hardly marked the people in the rocky streets, Spanish in
language, and in type quite Guanche, and but a step more
civilized than the wild tribesmen from the coast that he had
left.&nbsp; Then thinking maybe of his sojourn in London, and its
music-halls, frequented uninterestedly the house of Rita, Rita la
Jerezana; sat in the courtyard under the fig-tree with its trunk
coated with <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>white-wash, and listened to the &ldquo;Cante
Hondo,&rdquo; saw the girls dance Sevillanas; and drinking
zarzaparilla syrup, learned that of all the countries in the
world Spain is the richest, for there even the &ldquo;women of
the life&rdquo; cast their accounts in ounces.</p>
<p>Then growing weary of their chatter and their tales of woe,
each one of them being, according to herself, fallen from some
high estate, he wandered to the convent of the Franciscan
friars.&nbsp; They saw a convert in him, and put out all their
theologic powers; displayed, as they know how, the human aspect
of their faith, keeping the dogma out of sight; for well they
knew, in vain the net is spread in the sight of any man, if the
fires of hell are to be clearly seen.&nbsp; Long hours Mohanna
talked with them, enjoying argument for its own sake after the
Scottish and the Eastern way; the friars were mystified at the
small progress that they made, but said the renegade spoke
&ldquo;as he had a nest of nightingales all singing in his
mouth.&rdquo;&nbsp; And all the time his wife, an Arab of the
Arabs, sighed for the desert, in her Spanish clothes.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Velo de toalla&rdquo; and the high-heeled shoes, the pomps
and miseries of stays, and all the circumstance and starch of
European dress, did not console her for the loss of the black
tents, the familiar camels kneeling in the sand, the goats
skipping about the &ldquo;sudra&rdquo; bushes; and the church
bells made her but long more keenly for the call to prayers,
rising at evening from the straw-thatched mosque.&nbsp; Her <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>children,
left with the tribe, called to her from the desert, and she too
found neither resting-place nor rest in the quiet island
life.</p>
<p>At last Maron Mohanna turned again to trade, and entered into
partnership with one Benito Florez; bought a schooner, and came
and went between the islands and the coast.&nbsp; All things went
well with him, and in the little island town &ldquo;el
renegado&rdquo; rose to be quite a prosperous citizen, till on a
day he and his partner quarrelled and went to law.&nbsp; The law
in every country favours a man born in the land against a
foreigner; and the partnership broke up, leaving Mohanna almost
penniless.&nbsp; Whether one of those sudden furies which possess
the Arabs, turning them in a moment and without warning from
sedate well-mannered men to raving maniacs frothing at the mouth,
came over him, he never told; but what is certain is that, having
failed to slay his partner, he with his wife went off by night to
where his schooner lay, and instantly induced his men to put to
sea, and sailed towards the coast.&nbsp; Mohanna drew a perhaps
judicious veil of mystery over what happened on his arrival at
the inlet where his wife&rsquo;s tribe happened to be
encamped.&nbsp; One of the islanders either objecting to the
looting of the schooner upon principle, or perhaps because his
share of loot was insufficient, got himself killed; but what is a
&ldquo;Charuta&rdquo; more or less, except perhaps to his wife
and family in Arrecife or in some little dusty town <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>in Pico or
Gomera?&nbsp; Those who assented or were too frightened to
protest found themselves unmolested, and at liberty to take the
schooner back.&nbsp; Maron Mohanna and his wife, taking the boat
rowed by some Arabs, made for the shore, and what ensued he
subsequently related to a friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we get near the shore my wife she throw her
hat.&rdquo;&nbsp; One sees the hideous Cadiz hat floating upon
the surf, draggled and miserable, and its bunch of artificial
fruit, of flowers or feathers, bobbing about upon the backwash of
the waves.&nbsp; &ldquo;She throw her boots, and then she take
off all her clothes I got from Seville, cost me more than a
hundred &lsquo;real&rsquo;; she throw her parasol, and it float
in the water like a buoy, and make me mad.&nbsp; I pay more than
ten real for it.&nbsp; After all things was gone she wrap herself
in Arab sheet and step ashore just like an Arab girl, and all the
clothes I brought from Cadiz, cost more than a hundred real, all
was lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; What happened after their landing is
matter of uncertainty.&nbsp; Whether Mohanna found his children
growing up semi-savages, whether his wife having thus sacrificed
to the Graces, and made a holocaust of all her Cadiz clothes,
regretted them, and sitting by the beach fished for them sadly
with a cane, no man can tell.</p>
<p>Years passed away, and a certain English consul in Morocco
travelling to the Court stopped at a little town.&nbsp; Rivers
had risen, tribes had cut the road, our Lord the Sultan with his
camp was on a <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>journey and had eaten up the food upon the usual road,
or some one or another of the incidents of flood or field which
render travel in Morocco interesting had happened.&nbsp; The town
lay off the beaten track close to the territory of a half-wild
tribe.&nbsp; Therefore upon arrival at the place the consul found
himself received with scowling looks; no one proceeded to
hostilities, but he remained within his tent, unvisited but by a
soldier sent from the Governor to ask whether the Kaffir, son of
a Kaffir, wished for anything.&nbsp; People sat staring at him,
motionless except their eyes; children holding each other&rsquo;s
hands stood at a safe distance from his tent, and stared for
hours at him, and he remarked the place where he was asked to
camp was near a mound which from time immemorial seemed to have
been the common dunghill of the town.&nbsp; The night passed
miserably, the guards sent by the Governor shouting aloud at
intervals to show their vigilance, banished all chance of
sleep.</p>
<p>Cursing the place, at break of day the consul struck his camp,
mounted his horse, and started, leaving the sullen little town
all wrapped in sleep.&nbsp; But as he jogged along disconsolately
behind his mules, passing an angle of the &ldquo;Kasbah&rdquo;
wall, a figure, rising as it seemed out of the dunghill&rsquo;s
depths, advanced and stood before him in the middle of the
way.&nbsp; Its hair was long and matted and its beard ropy and
grizzled, and for sole covering it had a sack tied round its
waist with a string <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>of camel&rsquo;s hair; and as the
consul feeling in his purse was just about, in the English
fashion, to bestow his alms to rid himself of trouble, it
addressed him in his native tongue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-morning,
consul, how goes the world with you?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re the first
Christian I have seen for years.&nbsp; My name was once Mohanna,
now I am Sidi bu Zibbala, the Father of the Dunghill.&nbsp; Your
poet Shakespeare say that all the world&rsquo;s a stage, but he
was Englishman.&nbsp; I, Syrian, I say all the world
dunghill.&nbsp; I try him, Syria, England, the Desert, and New
York; I find him dung, so I come here and live here on this
dunghill, and find it sweet when compared to places I have seen;
and it is warm and dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ceased; and then the consul, feeling his words an outrage
upon progress and on his official status, muttered &ldquo;Queer
kind of fish,&rdquo; and jerking at his horse&rsquo;s bridle,
proceeded doggedly upon his way.</p>
<h2><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>LA
PULPERIA</h2>
<p><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span><span
class="smcap">It</span> may have been the Flor de Mayo, Rosa del
Sur, or Tres de Junio, or again but have been known as the
Pulperia upon the Huesos, or the Esquina on the
Napost&aacute;.&nbsp; But let its name have been what chance or
the imagination of some Neapolitan or Basque had given it, I see
it, and seeing it, dismounting, fastening my
&ldquo;redomon&rdquo; to the palenque, enter, loosen my facon,
feel if my pistol is in its place, and calling out
&ldquo;Carlon,&rdquo; receive my measure of strong, heady red
Spanish wine in a tin cup.&nbsp; Passing it round to the company,
who touch it with their lips to show their breeding, I seem to
feel the ceaseless little wind which always blows upon the
southern plains, stirring the dust upon the pile of fleeces in
the court, and whistling through the wooden &ldquo;reja&rdquo;
where the pulpero stands behind his counter with his pile of
bottles close beside him, ready for what may chance.&nbsp; For
outward visible signs, a low, squat, mud-built house, surrounded
by a shallow ditch on which grew stunted cactuses, and with paja
brava sticking out of the abode of the overhanging eaves.&nbsp;
Brown, sun-baked, dusty-looking, it stands up, an island in the
sea of waving <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>hard-stemmed grasses which the improving settler passes
all his life in a vain fight to improve away; and make his own
particular estancia an Anglo-Saxon Eden of trim sheep-cropped
turf, set here and there with &ldquo;agricultural
implements,&rdquo; broken and thrown aside, and though imported
at great trouble and expense, destined to be replaced by
ponderous native ploughs hewn from the solid &ntilde;andubay, and
which, of course, inevitably prove the superiority of the
so-called unfit.&nbsp; For inward graces, the &ldquo;reja&rdquo;
before which runs a wooden counter at which the flower of the
Gauchage of the district lounge, or sit with their toes sticking
through their potro boots, swinging their legs and keeping time
to the &ldquo;cielito&rdquo; of the &ldquo;payador&rdquo; upon
his cracked guitar, the strings eked out with fine-cut thongs of
mare&rsquo;s hide, by jingling their spurs.</p>
<p>Behind the wooden grating, sign in the Pampa of the eternal
hatred betwixt those who buy and those who sell, some shelves of
yellow pine, on which are piled ponchos from Leeds, ready-made
calzoncillos, alpargatas, figs, sardines, raisins,
bread&mdash;for bread upon the Pampa used to be eaten only at
Pulperias&mdash;saddle-cloths, and in a corner the
&ldquo;botilleria,&rdquo; where vermuth, absinthe, square-faced
gin, Carlon, and Vino Seco stand in a row, with the barrel of
Brazilian ca&ntilde;a, on the top of which the pulpero
ostentatiously parades his pistol and his knife.&nbsp; Outside,
the tracks led through the <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>biscacheras, all converging after
the fashion of the rails at a junction; at the palenque before
the door stood horses tied by strong raw-hide cabrestos, hanging
their heads in the fierce sun, shifting from leg to leg, whilst
their companions, hobbled, plunged about, rearing themselves on
their hind-legs to jump like kangaroos.</p>
<p>Now and then Gauchos rode up occasionally, their iron spurs
hanging off their naked feet, held by a raw-hide thong; some
dressed in black bombachas and vicu&ntilde;a ponchos, their
horses weighted down with silver, and prancing sideways as their
riders sat immovable, but swaying from the waist upwards like
willows in a wind.&nbsp; Others, again, on lean young colts,
riding upon a saddle covered with sheepskin, gripping the small
hide stirrup with their toes and forcing them up to the posts
with shouts of &ldquo;Ah bagual!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah
Pehuelche!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ahijuna!&rdquo; and with resounding
blows of their short, flat-lashed whips, which they held by a
thong between their fingers or slipped upon their wrists, then
grasping their frightened horses by the ears, got off as gingerly
as a cat jumps from a wall.&nbsp; From the rush-thatched,
mud-walled rancheria at the back the women, who always haunt the
outskirts of a pulperia in the districts known as tierra adentro
(the inside country), Indians and semi-whites, mulatresses, and
now and then a stray Basque or Italian girl turned out, to share
the quantity they considered love with all mankind.</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>But
gin and politics, with horses&rsquo; marks, accounts of fights,
and recollections of the last revolution, kept men for the
present occupied with serious things, so that the women were
constrained to sit and smoke, drink mat&eacute;, plait each
other&rsquo;s hair (searching it diligently the while), and wait
until Carlon with Vino Seco, square-faced rum, cachaza, and the
medicated log-wood broth, which on the Pampa passes for
&ldquo;Vino Franc&eacute;s,&rdquo; had made men sensible to their
softer charms.&nbsp; That which in Europe we call love, and think
by inventing it that we have cheated God, who clearly planted
nothing but an instinct of self-continuation in mankind, as in
the other animals, seems either to be in embryo, waiting for
economic advancement to develop it; or is perhaps not even
dormant in countries such as those in whose vast plains the
pulperia stands for club, exchange, for meeting-place, and
represents all that in other lands men think they find in Paris
or in London, and choose to dignify under the style of
intellectual life.&nbsp; Be it far from me to think that we have
bettered the Creator&rsquo;s scheme; or by the substitution of
our polyandry for polygamy, bettered the position of women, or in
fact done anything but changed and made more complex that which
at first was clear to understand.</p>
<p>But, be that as it may and without dogmatism, our love, our
vices, our rendering wicked things natural in themselves, our
secrecy, our pruriency, adultery, and all the myriad
ramifications of things <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>sexual, without which no novelist
could earn his bread, fall into nothing, except there is a
press-directed public opinion, laws, bye-laws, leaded type and
headlines, so to speak, to keep them up.&nbsp; True, nothing of
all this entered our heads as we sat drinking, listening to a
contest of minstrelsy &ldquo;por contrapunto&rdquo; betwixt a
Gaucho payador and a &ldquo;matrero negro&rdquo; of great fame,
who each in turn taking the cracked &ldquo;changango&rdquo; in
their lazo-hardened hands, plucked at its strings in such a style
as to well illustrate the saying that to play on the guitar is
not a thing of science, but requires but perseverance, hard
finger-tips, and an unusual development of strength in the right
wrist.&nbsp; Negro and payador each sang alternately; firstly old
Spanish love songs handed down from before the independence,
quavering and high; in which Frasquita rhymed to chiquita, and
one Cupido, whom I never saw in Pampa, loma, rincon, bolson, or
medano, in the Cha&ntilde;ares, amongst the woods of
&ntilde;andubay, the pajonales, sierras, cuchillas, or in all the
land, figured and did nothing very special; flourished, and then
departed in a high falsetto shake, a rough sweep of the hard
brown fingers over the jarring strings forming his fitting
epitaph.</p>
<p>The story of &ldquo;El Fausto,&rdquo; and how the Gaucho,
Aniceto, went to Buenos Ayres, saw the opera of
&ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; lost his pu&ntilde;al in the crush to take
his seat, sat through the fearsome play, saw face to face the <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>enemy of
man, described <a name="citation170a"></a><a href="#footnote170a"
class="citation">[170a]</a> as being dressed in long stockings to
the stifle-joint, eyebrows like arches for tilting at the wing,
and eyes like water-holes in a dry river bed, succeeded, and the
negro took up the challenge and rejoined.&nbsp; He told how,
after leaving town, that Aniceto mounted on his Overo rosao, <a
name="citation170b"></a><a href="#footnote170b"
class="citation">[170b]</a> fell in with his
&ldquo;compadre,&rdquo; told all his wondrous tale, and how they
finished off their bottle and left it floating in the river like
a buoy.</p>
<p>The payador, not to be left behind, and after having tuned his
guitar and put the &ldquo;cejilla&rdquo; on the strings, launched
into the strange life of Martin Fierro, type of the Gauchos on
the frontier, related his multifarious fights, his escapades, and
love affairs, and how at last he, his friend, Don Cruz, saw on an
evening the last houses as, with a stolen tropilla of good
horses, they passed the frontier to seek the Indians&rsquo;
tents.&nbsp; The death of Cruz, the combat of Martin with the
Indian chief&mdash;he with his knife, the Indian with the
bolas&mdash;and how Martin slew him and rescued the captive
woman, who prayed to heaven to aid the Christian, with <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>the body of
her dead child, its hands secured in a string made out of one of
its own entrails, lying before her as she watched the varying
fortunes of the fight, he duly told.&nbsp; La Vuelta de Martin
and the strange maxims of Tio Viscacha, that Pampa cynic whose
maxim was never to ride up to a house where dogs were thin, and
who set forth that arms are necessary, but no man can tell when,
were duly recorded by the combatants, listened to and received as
new and authentic by the audience, till at last the singing and
the frequent glasses of Carlon made payador and negro feel that
the time had come to leave off contrapunto and decide which was
most talented in music, with their facons.&nbsp; A personal
allusion to the colour of the negro&rsquo;s skin, a retort
calling in question the nice conduct of the sister of the
payador, and then two savages foaming at the mouth, their ponchos
wrapped round their arms, their bodies bent so as to protect
their vitals, and their knives quivering like snakes, stood in
the middle of the room.&nbsp; The company withdrew themselves
into the smallest space, stood on the tops of casks, and at the
door the faces of the women looked in delight, whilst the
pulpero, with a pistol and a bottle in his hands, closed down his
grating and was ready for whatever might befall.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Negro,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ahijuna,&rdquo; &ldquo;Miente,&rdquo;
&ldquo;carajo,&rdquo; and the knives flash and send out sparks as
the returns de tic au tac jar the fighters&rsquo; arms up to the
shoulder-joints.&nbsp; In a moment all is over, and from the
payador&rsquo;s right <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>arm the blood drops in a stream on
the mud floor, and all the company step out and say the negro is
a &ldquo;valiente,&rdquo; &ldquo;muy guapeton,&rdquo; and the two
adversaries swear friendship over a tin mug of gin.&nbsp; But all
the time during the fight, and whilst outside the younger men had
ridden races barebacked, making false starts to tire each
other&rsquo;s horses out, practising all the tricks they knew, as
kicking their adversary&rsquo;s horse in the chest, riding beside
their opponent and trying to lift him from his seat by placing
their foot underneath his and pushing upwards, an aged Gaucho had
gradually become the centre figure of the scene.</p>
<p>Seated alone he muttered to himself, occasionally broke into a
falsetto song, and now and then half drawing out his knife,
glared like a tiger-cat, and shouted &ldquo;Viva Rosas,&rdquo;
though he knew that chieftain had been dead for twenty years.</p>
<p>Tall and with straggling iron-grey locks hanging down his
back, a broad-brimmed plush hat kept in its place by a black
ribbon with two tassels under his chin, a red silk Chinese
handkerchief tied loosely round his neck and hanging with a point
over each shoulder-blade, he stood dressed in his chiripa and
poncho, like a mad prophet amongst the motley crew.&nbsp; Upon
his feet were potro boots, that is the skin taken off the
hind-leg of a horse, the hock-joint forming the heel and the hide
softened by pounding with a mallet, the whole tied with a garter
of a strange pattern woven by the Indians, <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>leaving the
toes protruding to catch the stirrups, which as a domador he
used, made of a knot of hide.&nbsp; Bound round his waist he had
a set of ostrich balls covered in lizard skin, and his broad belt
made of carpincho leather was kept in place by five Brazilian
dollars, and through it stuck a long facon with silver handle
shaped like a half-moon, and silver sheath fitted with a catch to
grasp his sash.&nbsp; Whilst others talked of women or of horses,
alluding to their physical perfections, tricks or predilections,
their hair, hocks, eyes, brands or peculiarities, discussing them
alternately with the appreciation of men whose tastes are simple
but yet know all the chief points of interest in both subjects,
he sat and drank.&nbsp; Tio Cabrera (said the others) is in the
past, he thinks of times gone by; of the Italian girl whom he
forced and left with her throat cut and her tongue protruding, at
the pass of the Pu&aacute;n; of how he stole the Indian&rsquo;s
horses, and of the days when Rosas ruled the land.&nbsp; Pucha,
compadre, those were times, eh?&nbsp; Before the
&ldquo;nations,&rdquo; English, Italian and Neapolitan, with
French and all the rest, came here to learn the taste of meat,
and ride, the &ldquo;maturangos,&rdquo; in their own countries
having never seen a horse.&nbsp; But though they talked at, yet
they refrained from speaking to him, for he was old, and even the
devil knows more because of years than because he is the devil,
and they knew also that to kill a man was to Tio Cabrera as
pleasant an exercise as for <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>them to kill a sheep.&nbsp; But at
last I, with the accumulated wisdom of my twenty years, holding a
glass of ca&ntilde;a in my hand, approached him, and inviting him
to drink, said, not exactly knowing why, &ldquo;Viva
Urquiza,&rdquo; and then the storm broke out.&nbsp; His eyes
flashed fire, and drawing his facon he shouted &ldquo;Muera! . .
.&nbsp; Viva Rosas,&rdquo; and drove his knife into the mud
walls, struck on the counter with the flat of the blade, foamed
at the mouth, broke into snatches of obscene and long-forgotten
songs, as &ldquo;Viva Rosas!&nbsp; Muera Urquiza dale guasca en
la petiza,&rdquo; whilst the rest, not heeding that I had a
pistol in my belt, tried to restrain him by all means in their
power.&nbsp; But he was maddened, yelled, &ldquo;Yes, I, Tio
Cabrera, known also as el Cordero, tell you I know how to play
the violin (a euphemism on the south pampa for cutting
throats).&nbsp; In Rosas&rsquo; time, Viva el General, I was his
right-hand man, and have dispatched many a Unitario dog either to
Trapalanda or to hell.&nbsp; Ca&ntilde;a, blood, Viva Rosas,
Muera!&rdquo; then tottering and shaking, his knife slipped from
his hands and he fell on a pile of sheepskins with white foam
exuding from his lips.&nbsp; Even the Gauchos, who took a life as
other men take a cigar, and from their earliest childhood are
brought up to kill, were dominated by his brute fury, and shrank
to their horses in dismay.&nbsp; The pulpero murmured
&ldquo;salvage&rdquo; from behind his bars, the women trembled
and ran to their &ldquo;tolderia,&rdquo; holding each other by
the hands, and the guitar-players <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>sat dumb, fearing their instruments
might come to harm.&nbsp; I, on the contrary, either impelled by
the strange savagery inherent in men&rsquo;s blood or by some
reason I cannot explain, caught the infection, and getting on my
horse, a half-wild &ldquo;redomon,&rdquo; spurred him and set him
plunging, and at each bound struck him with the flat edge of my
facon, then shouting &ldquo;Viva Rosas,&rdquo; galloped out
furiously upon the plain.</p>

177</span>HIGGINSON&rsquo;S DREAM</h2>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span><span
class="smcap">The</span> world went very well with Higginson; and
about that time&mdash;say fifteen years ago&mdash;he found
himself, his fortune made, settled down in Noumea.&nbsp; The
group of islands which he had, as he said, rescued from
barbarism, and in which he had opened the mines, made all the
harbours, and laid out all the roads, looked to him as their
Providence; and to crown the work, he had had them placed under
the French flag.&nbsp; Rich, <i>d&eacute;cor&eacute;,</i>
respected, and with no worlds to conquer in particular, he still
kept adding wealth to wealth; trading and doing what he
considered useful work for all mankind in general, as if he had
been poor.</p>
<p>Strange that a kindly man, a cosmopolitan, half French, half
English, brought up in Australia, capable, active, pushing, and
even not devoid of that interior grace a speculative intellect,
which usually militates against a man in the battle of his life,
should think that roads, mines, harbours, havens, ships, bills of
lading, telegraphs, tramways, a European flag, even the French
flag itself, could compensate his islanders for loss of
liberty.&nbsp; Stranger in his case than in the case of those who
<a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>go grown
up with all the prejudices, limitations, circumscriptions and
formalities of civilization become chronic in them, and see in
savage countries and wild peoples but dumping ground for European
trash, and capabilities for the extension of the Roubaix or the
Sheffield trade; for he had passed his youth amongst the islands,
loved their women, gone spearing fish with their young men, had
planted taro with them, drunk kava, learned their language, and
become as expert as themselves in all their futile arts and
exercises; knew their customs and was as one of them, living
their life and thinking it the best.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis said (Viera, I think, relates it) that in the last
years of fighting for the possession of Teneriffe, and when
Alonso de Lugo was hard pressed to hold his own against the last
Mencey, Bencomo, a strange sickness known as the
&ldquo;modorra&rdquo; seized the Guanches and killed more of them
than were slain in all the fights.&nbsp; The whole land was
covered with the dead, and once Alonso de Lugo met a woman
sitting on the hill-side, who called out, &ldquo;Where are you
going, Christian?&nbsp; Why do you hesitate to take the land? the
Guanches are all dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Spanish chroniclers say
that the sickness came about by reason of a wet season, and that,
coming as it did upon men weakened by privation, they fell into
apathy and welcomed death as a deliverer.&nbsp; That may be so,
and it is true that in hill-caves even to-day in the lone valleys
by <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>Icod
el Alto their bodies still are found seated and with the head
bowed on the arms, as if having sat down to mourn the afflictions
of their race, God had been merciful for once and let them
sleep.&nbsp; The chroniclers may have been right, and the wet
season, with despair, starvation and the hardships they endured,
may have brought on the mysterious &ldquo;modorra,&rdquo; the
drowsy sickness, under which they fell.&nbsp; But it needs
nothing but the presence of the conquering white man, decked in
his shoddy clothes, armed with his gas-pipe gun, his Bible in his
hand, schemes of benevolence deep rooted in his heart, his
merchandise (that is, his whisky, gin and cotton cloths) securely
stored in his corrugated iron-roofed sheds, and he himself active
and persevering as a beaver or red ant, to bring about a sickness
which, like the &ldquo;modorra,&rdquo; exterminates the people
whom he came to benefit, to bless, to rescue from their savagery,
and to make them wise, just, beautiful, and as apt to
differentiate evil from good as even he himself.&nbsp; So it
would seem, act as we like, our presence is a curse to all those
people who have preserved the primeval instincts of our
race.&nbsp; Curious, and yet apparently inevitable, that our
customs seem designed to carry death to all the so-called
inferior races, whom at a bound we force to bridge a period which
it has taken us a thousand years to pass.</p>
<p>In his prosperity, and even we may suppose during the Elysium
of dining with sous-pr&eacute;fets in <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>Noumea, and on the occasions when in
Melbourne or in Sydney he once again consorted with Europeans, he
always dreamed of a certain bay upon the coast far from Noumea,
where in his youth he had spent six happy months with a small
tribe, fishing and swimming, hunting, spearing fish, living on
taro and bananas, and having for a friend one Tean, son of a
chief, a youth of his own age.&nbsp; The vision of the happy life
came back to him; the dazzling beach, the heavy foliage of the
palao and bread-fruit trees; the grove of cocoa-nuts, and the
zigzag and intricate paths leading from hut to hut, which when a
boy he traversed daily, knowing them all by instinct in the same
way that horses in wild countries know how to return towards the
place where they were born.&nbsp; And still the vision haunted
him; not making him unhappy, for he was one of those who find
relief from thought in work, but always there in the same way
that the remembrance of a mean action is ever present, even when
one has made atonement, or induced oneself to think it was not
really mean, but rendered necessary by circumstances; or, in
fact, when we imagine we have put to sleep that inward
grasshopper which in our bosoms, blood, brain, stomach, or
wheresoever it is situated, is louder or more faint according to
our state of health, digestion, weakness, or what it is that
makes us hear its chirp.</p>
<p>And so it was that cheap champagne seemed flat to him; the
company of the yellow-haired and <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>faded <i>demi-mondaines</i> whom
Paris dumps upon New Caledonia insipid; the villas on the cliff
outside Noumea vulgar; and the prosperity and progress of the
place to which he had so much contributed, profitless and
stale.&nbsp; Not that for a single instant he stopped working,
planning and improving his estates, or missed a chance to acquire
&ldquo;town lots,&rdquo; or if a profitable 10,000 acres of good
land with river frontage came into the market, hesitated for a
moment to step in and buy.&nbsp; Now, though by this time he had
long got past the need of actually trading with the natives at
first hand, and kept, as rich men do, captains and secretaries
and lawyers to do his lying for him, and only now and then would
condescend to exercise himself in that respect when the stake was
large enough to make the matter reputable, yet sometimes he would
take a cruise in one of his own schooners and play at being
poor.&nbsp; Nothing so tickles a man&rsquo;s vanity as to look
back upon his semi-incredible past, and talk of the times when he
had to live on sixpence a day, and to recount his breakfast on a
penny roll and glass of milk, and then to put his hands upon his
turtle-bloated stomach, smile a fat smile and say, &ldquo;Ah,
those were the days, then I was happy!&rdquo; although he knows
that at that halcyon period he was miserable, not perhaps so much
from poverty, as from that envy which is as great a curse to poor
men as is indigestion to the rich.</p>
<p>So running down the coast of New Caledonia in <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>a schooner,
trading in pearls and copra, he came one evening to a
well-remembered bay.&nbsp; All seemed familiar to him, the low
white beach, tall palm-trees, coral reef with breakers thundering
over it, and the still blue lagoon inside the clump of breadfruit
trees, the single tall grey stone just by the beach all graven
over with strange characters, all struck a chord long dormant in
his mind.&nbsp; So telling his skipper to let go his anchor, he
rowed himself ashore.&nbsp; On landing he was certain of the
place; the tribe, about five hundred strong, ruled over by the
father of his friend Tean, lived right along the bay, and
scattered in palm-thatched huts throughout the district.&nbsp;
Then he remembered a certain cocoa-nut palm he used to climb, a
spring of water in a thicket of hibiscus, a little stream which
he used to dam, and then divert the course to take the fish, and
sitting down, all his past life came back to him.&nbsp; As he
himself would say, &ldquo;C&rsquo;etait le bon temps; pauvre Tean
il doit &ecirc;tre Areki (chef) maintenant; sa soeur
peut-&ecirc;tre est morte ou mari&eacute;e . . . elle
m&rsquo;aimait bien . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>But this day-dream dispelled, it struck him that the place
looked changed.&nbsp; Where were the long low huts in front of
which he used to pass his idle hours stretched in a hammock, the
little taro patches?&nbsp; The zigzag paths which used to run
from house to house across the fields to the spring and to the
turtle-pond were all grown up.&nbsp; Couch-grass and rank mimosa
scrub, with here and there <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>ropes of lianas, blocked them so
that he rubbed his eyes and asked himself, Where is the
tribe?&nbsp; Vainly he shouted, cooeed loudly; all was silent,
and his own voice came back to him muffled and startling as it
does when a man feels he is alone.&nbsp; At last, following one
of the paths less grown up and obliterated than the rest, he
entered a thick scrub, walked for a mile or two cutting lianas
now and then with his jack-knife, stumbling through swamps,
wading through mud, until in a little clearing he came upon a
hut, in front of which a man was digging yams.&nbsp; As many of
the natives in New Caledonia speak English and few French, he
called to him in English, &ldquo;Where black man?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Resting upon his hoe, the man replied, &ldquo;All
dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where Chief?&rdquo;&nbsp; And the same
answer, &ldquo;Chief, he dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Tean, he
dead?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, Tean Chief; he ill, die soon; Tean
inside that house.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Higginson, not understanding,
but feeling vaguely that his dream was shattered in some way he
could not understand, called out, &ldquo;Tean, oh, Tean, your
friend Johnny here!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then from the hut emerged a
feeble man leaning upon a long curved stick, who gazed at him as
he had seen a ghost.&nbsp; At last he said, &ldquo;That you,
John?&nbsp; I glad to see you once before I die.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whether they embraced, shook hands, rubbed noses, or what their
greeting was is not recorded, for Higginson, in alluding to it,
always used to say, &ldquo;C&rsquo;est b&ecirc;te, mais le pauvre
homme me faisait de la peine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>This
was his sickness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Me sick, John; why you wait so
long? you no remember, so many years ago when we spear fish, you
love my sister, she dead five years ago . . .&nbsp; When me go
kaikai (eat) piece sugar-cane, little bit perhaps fall on the
ground, big bird he come eat bit of sugar-cane and eat my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Higginson being a civilized man, with the full knowledge
of all things good and evil contingent on his state, still was
dismayed, but said, &ldquo;No, Tean, I get plenty big gun; you
savey when I shoot even a butterfly he fall.&nbsp; I shoot big
bird so that when you go kaikai he no eat pieces, and you get
well again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus Higginson from his altitude argued
with the semi-savage, thinking, as men will think, that even
death can be kept off with words.&nbsp; But Tean smiled and said,
&ldquo;Johnny, you savey heap, but you no savey all.&nbsp; This
time I die.&nbsp; You go shoot bird he turn into a mouse, and
mouse eat all I eat, just the same bird.&rdquo;&nbsp; This rather
staggered Higginson, and he felt his theories begin to vanish,
and he began to feel a little angry; but really loving his old
friend, he once more addressed himself to what he now saw might
be a hopeless task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go Noumea get big black cat, beautiful cat, all the
same tiger&mdash;you savey tiger, Tean?&mdash;glossy and fat,
long tail and yellow eyes; when he see mouse he eat him; you go
bed sleep, get up, and soon quite well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tean, who by
this time had changed position with his friend, and become out of
his <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>knowledge a philosopher, shook his head sadly and
replied, &ldquo;You no savey nothing, John; when black man know
he die there is no hope.&nbsp; Suppose cat he catch mouse, all no
use; mouse go change into a big, black cloud, all the same
rain.&nbsp; Rain fall upon me, and each drop burn right into my
bones.&nbsp; I die, John, glad I see you; black man all die,
black woman no catch baby, tribe only fifty &rsquo;stead of five
hundred.&nbsp; We all go out, all the same smoke, we vanish, go
up somewhere, into the clouds.&nbsp; Black men and white men, he
no can live.&nbsp; New Caledonia (as you call him) not big enough
for both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What happened after that Higginson never told, for when he
reached that point he used to break out into a torrent of half
French, half English oaths, blaspheme his gods, curse progress,
rail at civilization, and recall the time when all the tribe were
happy, and he and Tean in their youth went spearing fish.&nbsp;
And then bewildered, and as if half-conscious that he himself had
been to blame, would say, &ldquo;I made the roads, opened the
mines, built the first pier, I opened up the island; ah, le
pauvre Tean, il me faisait de la peine . . . et sa soeur morte .
. . she was so pretty with a hibiscus wreath . . . ah, well,
pauvre petite . . . je l&rsquo;aimais bien.&rdquo;</p>

189</span>CALVARY</h2>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span><span
class="smcap">Just</span> where the River Plate, split by a
hundred islands, forms a sort of delta, a tract of marshy land in
Entre Rios, known as the Rincones of the Ibicuy, spreads out
flat, cut by a thousand channels, heavily timbered, shut in upon
the landward side by a long range of hills of dazzling sand, and
buried everywhere in waving masses of tall grass.</p>
<p>Grass, grass, and yet more grass.&nbsp; Grass at all seasons
of the year, so that the half-wild horses never know the scarcity
of pasture which in the winter makes them lean and rough upon the
outside plains.&nbsp; A district shut by its sand-hills and the
great river from the outer world.&nbsp; A paradise for horses,
cattle, tigers, myriads of birds, for capibaras, nutrias, and for
the stray Italians who now and then come from the cities with a
rotten boat, and miserable, cheap, Belgian gun, to slaughter
ducks.</p>
<p>The population, sparse and indolent, a hybrid breed between
the Gauchos and the Chanar Indians, who at the conquest retreated
into the thickest swamps and islands of the River Plate.&nbsp;
But still a country where life flows easily away amongst the
cane-brakes, thickets of espinillo, tala and &ntilde;andubay, and
where from out the pajonales the <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>half-wild horses bound like
antelopes, shaking their manes, their tails aloft like flags,
snorting and frisking in the pride of strength, and lighting up
the landscape with their variegated colours like a herd of fallow
deer.&nbsp; A land of vegetation so intense as to bedwarf mankind
almost as absolutely as we bedwarf ourselves with our machinery
in a manufacturing town.&nbsp; Air plants upon the trees;
oven-birds&rsquo; earthen, gourd-like nests hanging from boughs;
great wasp nests in the hollows of the trunks; scarlet and
rose-pink flamingoes fishing in the shallow pools; nutrias
floating down the streams, their round and human-looking heads
appearing just awash; and the dark silent channels of the
stagnant backwaters, so thickly grown with water weeds that by
throwing a few branches on the top a man may cross his horse.</p>
<p>Commerce, that vivifying force, that bond of union between all
the basest instincts of the basest of mankind, that touch of
lower human nature which makes all the lowest natures of mankind
akin, was quite unknown.&nbsp; Cheating was elementary, and
rarely did much harm but to the successful cheat; at times a
neighbour passed a leaden dollar on a friend, was soon detected,
and was branded as a thief; at times a man slaughtered a
neighbour&rsquo;s cow, and sold the hide, stole a good horse, or
perpetrated some piece of petty villainy, sufficient by its
transparent folly to reassure the world that he was quite
uncivilized, and not fit by his exertions ever to grow rich.</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>Adultery and fornication were frequent, and, again,
chiefly concerned the principals, as there were no
self-instituted censors, eager to carry tales, and to revenge
themselves upon the world for their own impotency.</p>
<p>All were apt lazoers, great with the bolas, and all rode as
they had issued from their mothers&rsquo; wombs mounted upon a
foal, and grown together with him, half horse, half
man&mdash;quiet and almost blameless centaurs, and as happy as it
is possible for men to be who come into the world ready baptized
in tears.</p>
<p>So much for man in the Rincones of the Ibicuy, and let us
leave him quiet and indolent, fighting occasionally at the
&ldquo;Pulperia&rdquo; for a quart of wine, for jealousy, for
politics, or any of the so-called reasons which make men shed
each other&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>But commerce, holy commerce, thrice blessed nexus which makes
the whole world kin, reducing all men to the lowest common
multiple; commerce that curses equally both him who buys and him
who sells, and not content with catching all men in its ledgers,
envies the animals their happy lives, was on the watch.&nbsp;
Throughout the boundaries of the River Plate, from Corrientes to
the bounds of Tucuman, San Luis de la Punta to San Nicholas, and
to the farthest limits of the stony southern plains, nowhere were
horses cheaper than in the close Rincones of the Ibicuy.&nbsp;
Three, four, or five, or at the most six dollars, bought the
best, <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>especially if but half-tamed, and a convenient curve of
the river allowed a steamboat to discharge or to load goods, tied
to a tree and moored beside the bank.</p>
<p>Upon a day a steamer duly arrived, whistled, and anchored, and
from her, in a canoe, appeared a group of men who landed, and
with the assistance of a guide went to the chief estancia of the
place.&nbsp; The owner, Cruz Cabrera, called also Cruz el
Narigudo, came to his door, welcomed them, driving off his dogs,
wondered, but still said nothing, as it is not polite to ask a
stranger what is the business that brings him to your
house.&nbsp; Mat&eacute; went round, and gin served in a
square-faced bottle, and drank out of a solitary wine-glass, the
stem long snapped in the middle, and spliced by shrinking a piece
of green cow-hide round a thin cane, and fastening the cane into
a disc of roughly-shaped soft wood.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three dollars by
the cut, and I&rsquo;ll take fifty.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, four
and a half; my horses are the best of the whole
district.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so the ignoble farce of bargaining,
which from the beginning of the world has been the touchstone of
the zero of the human heart, pursued its course.</p>
<p>At last the &ldquo;higgling of the
market&rdquo;&mdash;God-descended phrase&mdash;dear to economists
and those who in their studies apart from life weave webs in
which mankind is caught, decreed that at four dollars the deal
was to be made.&nbsp; But at the moment of arrangement one of the
strangers saw a fine chestnut colt standing saddled at the door,
and <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>claimed him as a &ldquo;sweetener,&rdquo; and to save
talk his master let him go, and then, the money counted over, the
buyer, prepared to give a hand to catch the horses, and to lead
them singly to the boat.&nbsp; Plunging and snorting, sweating
with terror, and half dead with fear, kicked, cuffed, and pricked
with knives, horse after horse was forced aboard, and stood tied
to a ring or stanchion, the sweat falling in drops like rain from
legs and bellies on the deck.&nbsp; Only the chestnut stood
looking uneasily about, and frightened by the struggles and the
sound of blows falling upon the backs of those his once
companions in the wild gallops through the forest glades, who had
been forced aboard.</p>
<p>Then Cruz Cabrera cursed his folly with an oath, and getting
for the last time on his back made him turn, passage, plunge, and
started and checked him suddenly, then getting off unsaddled him,
and gave his halter to a man to lead him to the ship.&nbsp; The
horse resisted, terrified at the strange unusual sight, and one
of the strangers, raising his iron whip, struck him across the
nose, exclaiming with an oath, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you what it
is to make a fuss, you damned four dollars&rsquo; worth, when
once I get you safe aboard the ship.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Cruz
Cabrera, gripping his long knife, was grieved, and said much as
to the chastity of the stranger&rsquo;s mother, and of his wife,
but underneath his breath, not that he feared to cut a
&ldquo;gringo&rsquo;s&rdquo; throat, but that the dollars kept
him quiet, as they have rendered dumb, priests, ministers of
state, bishops and merchants, princes and peasants, <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>and have
closed the mouths of three parts of mankind, making them silent
complices in all the villainies they see and hate, and still dare
not denounce, fearing the scourge of poverty, and the smart lash
which Don Dinero flourishes over the shoulders of all those who
venture even remotely to express their thoughts.</p>
<p>Quickly the Ibicuy melted into the mist, as the wheezy steamer
grunted and squattered like a wounded wild duck, down the yellow
flood.&nbsp; Inside, the horses, more dead than alive, panted
with thirst, and yet were still too timid to approach the water
troughs.&nbsp; They slipped and struggled on the deck, fell and
plunged up again, and at each fall or plunge, the blows fell on
their backs, partly from folly, partly from the satisfaction that
some men feel in hurting anything which fate or Providence has
placed without the power of resistance in their hands.&nbsp;
Instinct and reason; the hypothetic difference which good weak
men use as an an&aelig;sthetic when their conscience pricks them
for their sins of omission and commission to their four-footed
brethren.&nbsp; But a distinction wholly without a difference,
and a link in the long chain of fraud and force with which we
bind all living things, men, animals, and most of all our
reasoning selves, in one crass neutral-tinted slavery.&nbsp; Who
that has never put his bistouri upon the soul, and hitherto no
vivisectionist (of men or animals) can claim the feat, shall say
who suffers most&mdash;the biped or the four-footed animal?&nbsp;
I know the cant of education, <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>the higher organism, and the
dogmatics of the so-called scientists which bid so fair to
worthily replace those of the theologians, but who shall say if
animals, when suddenly removed from all that sanctifies their
lives, do not pass agonies far more intense than such endured by
those whose education or whose reason&mdash;what you
will&mdash;still leaves them hope?</p>
<p>By the next morning the wheezy, wood-fired steamer was in the
roads of Buenos Ayres, the exiles of the Ibicuy with coats all
starring, flanks tucked up, hanging their heads, no more the
lightsome creatures of but yesterday.</p>
<p>Steam launches, pitching like porpoises in the shallow stream,
whale-boats manned by Italians girt with red sashes, and with
yellow shirts made beautiful with scarlet horse-shoes, and whose
eyes glistened like diamonds in their roguish, nut-coloured
faces, came alongside the ship.&nbsp; Lighters, after much
expenditure of curses and vain reaches with boat-hooks at the
paddle-floats, hooked on, and dropped astern.&nbsp; The
donkey-engine started with a whirr, giving the unwilling
passengers another tremor of alarm, and then the work of lowering
them into the flat-bottomed lighters straight began.&nbsp;
Kickings and strugglings, and one by one, their coats all matted
with the sweat of terror, they were dropped into the boat.&nbsp;
One or two slipped from the slings, and landed with a broken leg,
and then a dig with a &ldquo;facon&rdquo; ended their troubles,
and their bodies floated on the shallow waves, followed by flocks
of gulls.&nbsp; Puffing and pitching, <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>the tug dragging the lighter reached
the ocean-steamer&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; Again the donkey-engine
rattled and whirred, and once again the luckless animals were
hoisted up, stowed on the lower deck in rows in semi-darkness,
and after a due interval the vessel put to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would not sell a farm and go to sea?&rdquo; the
sailor says, and turns his quid remarking, &ldquo;Go to sea for
pleasure, yes, and to hell for fun.&rdquo;&nbsp; The smell of
steam, confinement, the motion of the ship, monotony of days,
time marked but by the dinner-bell, a hell to passengers who in
their cabins curse the hours, and kill the time with cards,
books, drink and flirtation, and yet find every day a week.&nbsp;
But to the exiles of the Ibicuy, stricken with terror, too ill to
eat, parching, and yet afraid to drink, hopeless and fevered,
sick at heart, slipping and falling, bruised with each motion of
the ship, beaten when restless, and perhaps in some dim way
conscious of having left their birthplace, and foreseeing nothing
but misery, who shall say what they endured during the passage,
in the hot days, the stifling nights, and in the final change to
the dark skies and chilling breezes of the north?&nbsp; Happiest
those who died without the knowledge of the London streets, and
whose bruised carcasses were flung into the sea, their coats
matted with sweat and filth, legs swelled, and heads hanging down
limply as they trailed the bodies on the decks.</p>
<p>The docks, the dealer&rsquo;s yard, the breaking in to
harness, and the sale at Aldridge&rsquo;s, and one by one <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>they were
led out to meet no more; as theologians who have blessed man with
hell, allow no paradise to beasts.&nbsp; Perhaps because their
lives being innocent, they would have filled it up so that no man
could enter, for what saint in any calendar could for an instant
claim to be admitted if his life were compared to that of the
most humble of his four-footed brethren in the Lord?&nbsp; Docked
duly, to show that nature does not know how to make a horse,
bitted and broken, the chestnut colt, once Cruz Cabrera&rsquo;s
pride, started on cab work, and for a time gave satisfaction to
his owner, for, though not fast, he was untiring, and, as his
driver said, &ldquo;yer couldn&rsquo;t kill &rsquo;im, &rsquo;e
was a perfect glutton for &rsquo;ard work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Streets, streets, and yet more streets, endless and
sewer-like, stony and wood-paved, suburbs interminable, and
joyless squares, gaunt stuccoed crescents, &ldquo;vales,&rdquo;
&ldquo;groves,&rdquo; &ldquo;places,&rdquo; a perfect wilderness
of bricks, he trotted through them all.&nbsp; Derbies and
boat-races, football matches, Hurlingham and the Welsh Harp,
Plaistow and Finchley, Harrow-on-the-Hill, the wait at theatres,
the nightly crawl up Piccadilly watching for fares, where men and
women stop to talk; rain, snow, ice, frost, and the fury of the
spring east wind, he knew them all, struggled and shivered,
baked, shook with fatigue, and still resisted.&nbsp; But time,
that comes upon us and our horses, stealthily creeping like
Indians creep upon the war trail without a sign, loosening the
sinews of our knees, thickening their wind, and making both of us
useless except for worms, began <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>to tell.&nbsp; The chronic cough,
the groggy feet, the eye covered with a cloud, caused by a flick
inside the blinkers, and the staring coat, soon turned the
chestnut, from a cab with indiarubber tyres, celluloid fittings,
and a looking-glass upon each side (for fools to see how
impossible it is that they can ever have been made after
God&rsquo;s image), to a night hack, and then the fall to a
fish-hawker&rsquo;s cart was not too long delayed.</p>
<p>Blows and short commons, sores from the collar, and continued
overwork, slipping upon the greasy streets, struggling with loads
impossible to move, finished the tragedy; and of the joyous colt
who but a year or two ago bounded through thickets scarcely
brushing off the dew, nothing was left but a gaunt, miserable,
lame, wretched beast, a very bag of bones, too thin for
dog&rsquo;s meat, and too valueless even to afford the mercy of
the knacker&rsquo;s fee.&nbsp; So, struggling on upon his Via
Crucis, Providence at last remembered, and let him fall, and the
shaft entering his side, his blood coloured the pavement; his
owner, after beating him till he was tired, gave him a farewell
kick or two; then he lay still, his eyes open and staring, and
white foam exuding from his mouth.</p>
<p>The scent of horse dung filled the fetid air, cabs rattled,
and vans jolted on the stones, and the dead horse, bloody and
mud-stained, formed, as it were, a sort of island, parting the
traffic into separate streams, as it surged onward roaring in the
current of the streets.</p>

up says he, &lsquo;Hell-fire, ye didna gie me ony chance,&rsquo;
and the blood spouted from his mouth into the boiling pan.</p>

class="smcap">Ranks</span> upon ranks of rastaquo&egrave;res,
Brazilians, Roumanians, Russians, Bulgarians, with battalions of
Americans, all seated round the &ldquo;piazza&rdquo; of the Grand
Hotel.&nbsp; Ladies from Boston, Chicago, and New York, their
heels too high, their petticoats too much belaced, their Empire
combs bediamonded so as to look almost like cut-glass
chandeliers, as in their chairs they sat and read the latest news
from Tampa, Santiago, and how Cervera&rsquo;s Squadron met the
fate which they (the ladies) reckoned God prepares for those who
dare to fight against superior odds.</p>
<p>Outside upon the boulevards, cocottes, guides, cabmen, and
androgynous young men, touts, and all those who hang about that
caravansary where the dulcet Suffolk whine, made sharper by the
air of Massachusetts, sounds, passed and repassed.</p>
<p>Smug-faced, black-coated citizens from Buffalo and Albany, and
from places like Detroit and Council Bluffs, to which the breath
of fashion has not penetrated, scanned the <i>New York
Herald</i>, read the glorious news, and, taking off their hats,
deigned publicly to recognize the existence of a God, and after
standing reverently silent, <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>masticating their green cigars in
contemplation of His wondrous ways, to take a drink.</p>
<p>Aquatic plants and ferns known only to hotels, and
constituting a sub-family of plants, which by the survival of the
ugliest have come at last to stand gas, dust, saliva, and an air
befogged with Chypre, grew in the fountain where, in the tepid
water, gold fish with swollen eyes, and blotched with patches of
unhealthy white, swam to and fro, picking up crumbs and rising to
the surface when some one threw a smoked-out cigarette into the
basin, in the midst of which a fig-leaved Naiad held a stucco
shell.</p>
<p>The corridors were blocked with Saratoga trunks; perspiring
porters staggered to and fro, bending beneath the weight of
burdens compared to which a sailor&rsquo;s chest is as a
pill-box.</p>
<p>All went well; the tapes clicked off their international lies,
detailing all the last quotations of the deep mines upon the
Rand, the fall in Spanish Fours; in fact, brought home to those
with eyes to see, the way in which the Stock Exchange had put a
rascals&rsquo; ring around the globe.</p>
<p>Waiters ran to and fro, their ears attuned to every outrage
upon French, seeking to find the meaning of the jargons in which
they were addressed.</p>
<p>Majestic butlers in black knee-breeches, and girt about the
neck with great brass chains, moved slowly up and down, so grave
and so respectable that had you laid your hands upon any one of
them <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>and
made a bishop of him he would have graced the post.</p>
<p>Mysterious, well-dressed men sat down beside you, and after a
few words proposed to take you in the evening to show you
something new.</p>
<p>Women walked to and fro, glaring at one another as they had
all been tigresses, or again, catching each other&rsquo;s eyes,
reddened, and looked ashamed, as if aware, though strangers, that
they understood the workings of the other&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Burano chandeliers and modern tapestry, with red brocade on
the two well-upholstered chairs, imparted beauty and a look of
wealth, making one feel as if by striking an electric bell a door
would open and a troop of half-dressed women file into the court,
after the fashion of another kind of inn.</p>
<p>Outside the courtyard Paris roared, chattered, and yelped,
cycles and automobiles made the poor <i>pi&eacute;ton&rsquo;s</i>
life a misery, and set one thinking how inferior after all the
Mind which thought out Eden was to our own.</p>
<p>Upon the asphalt the horizontales lounged along, pushing
against the likely-looking passer-by like cats against a
chair.</p>
<p>Cabs rattled, and the whole <i>clinquant</i> town wore its
best air of unreality, which it puts off alone upon the morning
of a revolution.</p>
<p>Through boulevards, parvis, cit&eacute;s, along the quays, in
the vast open spaces which, like Saharas of grey stone, make the
town desolate, in caf&eacute;s, brothels, theatres, in church and
studio, and <a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>wherever men most congregate, groups stood about
reading the news, gesticulating, weeping, perspiring, and agog
with a half-impotent enthusiastic orgasm of wildest admiration
for Spain, Cervera, and the men who without bunkum or illusion
steamed to certain death.&nbsp; And, curiously enough, the
execration fell not so much upon Chicago as on &ldquo;ces cochons
d&rsquo;Anglais,&rdquo; who by their base connivance had wrought
the ruin of the Spanish cause.</p>
<p>Yankees themselves read and remarked with sneers that
England&rsquo;s turn was coming next, and after
&ldquo;Kewby,&rdquo; that they reckoned to drag the British flag
through every dunghill in New York; then one winked furtively and
said, &ldquo;We need them now, but afterwards we&rsquo;ll show
Victoria in a cage for a picayune a peep, and teach the
Britishers what to do with their old Union Jack,&rdquo; thinking
no doubt of the ten-cent paper which is sold in every city of the
States, stamped with the Spanish flag.</p>
<p>And as I sat, musing on things and others&mdash;thinking, for
instance, that when you scratch a man and see his blood you know
his nature by the way he bears his wound, and that the Spaniards,
wounded to the death, were dying game (after the fashion of the
English in times gone by, before Imperialism, before the
Nonconformist snuffle, the sweating system, and the rest had
changed our nature), and that the Yankees at the first touch
cried out like curs, though they had money, numbers, and
everything upon their side&mdash;I fell a-thinking on the Spain
of old.&nbsp; Inigo Lopez de <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>Mendoza, el Gran Capitan, Cortes
(not at the siege of Mexico, but in the rout before Algiers) came
up before me, and I thought on the long warfare, extending over
seven hundred years, by which Spain saved the southern half of
Europe from the Moors; upon Gerona, Zaragoza, and, most of all,
upon Cervera, last of the Quixotes, Vara de Rey, Linares, and the
poor peasants from Galician hills, thyme-scented wastes in Lower
Aragon, Asturian mountains, and Estremenian oak-woods, who,
battling against superior numbers, short of food, of ammunition,
and bereft of hope, were proving their descent from the grim
soldiers of the Spanish &ldquo;Tercios&rdquo; of the Middle Ages,
and making the invaders of their country pay for their piracy in
blood.</p>
<p>Blood is the conqueror&rsquo;s coin the whole world over, and
if the island which Columbus found for Spain pass into other
hands, let those who take it pour out their blood like water to
inaugurate their reign of peace.</p>
<p>Where the connection between the senses and the brain comes
in, which influences first, and how, or whether a wise
Providence, always upon His guard (after the fashion of an
operator in a Punch and Judy show), influences each man directly,
as by celestial thought suggestion, I cannot tell.</p>
<p>All that I know is, that once walking on the rampart gardens
which in Cadiz overhang the sea and form the outside rim of the
&ldquo;Taza de Plata,&rdquo; as the Spaniards call the town, I on
a sudden saw <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>the River Plate.&nbsp; The Gauchos, plains, wild
horses, the stony wastes, the ostriches (the &ldquo;Alegria del
Desierto&rdquo;), came up before me, and in especial a certain
pass over a little river called the Gualiyan; the sandy dip, the
metallic-looking trees, the greenish river with the flamingoes
and white herons and the black-headed swans; the vultures sitting
motionless on the dead trees, and most of all the penetrating
scent of the mimosa, known to the natives as the &ldquo;espinillo
de olor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning and wondering why, I saw a stunted tree with yellow
blossoms duly ticketed with its description &ldquo;Mimosa&rdquo;
this or that, and with its &ldquo;habitat&rdquo; the warmer
district of the River Plate.</p>
<p>I leave these things to wise philosophers and to those men of
science who seem to think mankind is worth the martyrdom of
living dogs and cats; or who, maybe, drag out the entrails of
their quivering fellow-mortals merely to stimulate their senses
or erotic powers.</p>
<p>But the &ldquo;dwawm&rdquo; over, looking about, fenced in by
swarms of overjoyed Americans, all talking shrilly, reading out
the news, exultant at the triumph of their fleet, puffed up and
arrogant as only the descendants of the Puritans can be, I saw a
Spaniard sitting with his daughter, a girl about nineteen.</p>
<p>Himself a Castellano rancio, silent and grave, dressed all in
black, moustache waxed to a point, square little feet like boxes,
brown little hands, face like mahogany, hair cropped close, and
with the <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>unillusional fatalistic air of worldly wisdom mixed
with simplicity which characterizes Spaniards of the older
school.</p>
<p>Being a Christian, he spoke no tongue but that which
Christians use, was proud of it, proud of his ignorance, proud (I
have no doubt) of his descent.</p>
<p>No doubt he saw everything through the clear dazzling
atmosphere of old Castille, which Spaniards of his kind seem to
condense and carry off with them for use in other climes.</p>
<p>Seeing so clearly, he saw nothing clear, for the intelligence
of man is so contrived as to be ineffective if a mist of some
sort is not interposed.</p>
<p>The daughter fair, fair with the fairness of a Southern,
blue-eyed, and skin like biscuit china, hands and feet fine, head
well set on, and yet with the decided gestures and incisive
speech, the &ldquo;aire recio,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;meneo&rdquo;
of the hips in walking, of the women of her race.</p>
<p>They sat some time before a pile of newspapers, the father
smoking gravely, taking down the smoke as he were drinking it,
and then in a few minutes breathing it out to serve as an
embellishment to what he said, holding his cigarette meanwhile
fixed in a little silver instrument contrived like two clasped
hands.</p>
<p>The Spanish newspapers were, of course, all without news, or
said they had none, and as the daughter read, the old man
punctuated with &ldquo;Valiente,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pobrecitas,&rdquo;
and the like, when he heard how before El Caney, Vara de Rey had
<a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>died, or
how the Americans had shot the three Sisters of the Poor whose
bodies were found lying with lint and medicine in their
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read me the papers of the Americans, hija de mi
corazon,&rdquo; and she began, translating as she read.</p>
<p>Reading of the whole agony, choking but self-possessed, she
read: the <i>Vizcaya</i>, <i>Almirante Oquendo</i>, and the rest;
the death of Villamil, he who at least redeemed the promise made
to the Mother of his God in Cadiz before he put to sea.</p>
<p>And as she read the old man gave no sign, sitting impassive as
a fakir, or like an Indian warrior at the stake.</p>
<p>She went on reading; the fleet steamed through the hell of
shot and shell, took fire, was beached, blew up, and still he
gave no sign.</p>
<p>Cervera steps on board the conqueror&rsquo;s ship, weeping,
gives up his sword, and the old man sat still.</p>
<p>When all was finished, and the last vessel burning on the
rocks, slowly the tears fell down his old brown cheeks, and he
broke silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Virgen de Guadalupe, has not one
escaped?&rdquo; and the girl, looking at him through her now
misty eyes, &ldquo;No, papa, God has so willed it. . . .&nbsp;
What is wrong with your moustache?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with an effort, he took down his grief, said quietly,
&ldquo;I must change my hairdresser,&rdquo; got up, and offering
his daughter his arm, walked out impassible, through the thick
ranks of the defeated foe.</p>

219</span>ROTHENBERGER&rsquo;S WEDDING</h2>
<p><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span><span
class="smcap">Short</span> and broad-shouldered, with the flaxen
hair and porcelain-coloured eyes of the true man of Kiel or
Koenigsberg, Dr. Karl Rothenberger prided himself on being a
townsman of the Great Kant, &ldquo;who make the critique of pure
sense.&rdquo;&nbsp; For him in vain the modern mystic spread his
nets; his mass, his psychological research, his ethics based on
the saving of his own gelatinous soul, said nothing to the man of
Koenigsberg.&nbsp; His work to minister by electricity to the
rheumatic, the gouty; to those who had loved perhaps well, but
certainly in a vicarious and post-prandial fashion; his passion
fishing with a float; a &ldquo;goode felawe,&rdquo; not too
refined, but yet well educated; his literary taste bounded by
idealistic novels about materialistic folk, and the drum-taps of
the bards of Anglo-Saxon militarism; the doctor looked on the
world as a vast operating theatre, sparing not even his own
foibles in his diagnosis of mankind.&nbsp; All sentiment he held
if not accursed, yet as superfluous, and though he did not pride
himself exactly on his opinions, knowing them well to be but the
result of education, and of a few molecules of iron, more or
less, in the <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>composition of his blood, yet would deliver them to all
and sundry, as he were lecturing to students in a
university.&nbsp; Women he held inferior to men, as really do
almost all men, although they fear to say so; but again, he said,
&ldquo;de womens they have occupy my mind since I was eighteen
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So after many wanderings in divers lands, he came, as wise men
will, to London, and set up his household gods in a vast
plane-tree-planted square (with cat ground in the middle called a
garden), and of which the residents each had a key, but never
walked in, sat in, or used in any way, though all of them would
have gone to the stake rather than see a member of the public
enter into its sacred precincts, or a stray child play in it,
unless attended by a nurse.</p>
<p>Honours and fees fell thick on Rothenberger, and he became
greatly belettered, member of many a learned, dull society.&nbsp;
He duly purchased a degree; and squares and crescents quite a
mile away sent out their patients, and were filled with the
sonorous glory of his name.&nbsp; One thing was wanting, and that
one thing troubled him not a little; but he yet saw it was
inevitable if he would rise to Harley Street or Saville Row, and
the sleek pair of horses which (without bearing-reins) testify to
a doctor&rsquo;s status in the scientific world.&nbsp; A wife, or
as he said, a &ldquo;real legitimate,&rdquo; to prove to all his
patients that he was a moral man.&nbsp; Strange that the domestic
arrangements of a public man should <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>militate for or against him; but so
it is, at least in England, where even if a man cheat and spread
ruin to thousands, yet he may find apologists, chiefly, of
course, amongst that portion of the public who have not suffered
by his delinquencies, so that his life be what is known as
pure.&nbsp; Morals and purity in our group of islands seem to
condone drunkenness, lies, and even theft (so that the sum stolen
be large enough), and to have crystallized themselves into a
censorship of precisely the very thing as to which no man or
woman has the right to call another to account.</p>
<p>So Rothenberger, looking about for a vessel by means of which
to purify himself (and push his business), lit on a girl with
money, living, as he said, &ldquo;oot by Hampstead way;&rdquo;
went through the process known as courting, in a mixture of
German and of English, eked out with Plaat-Deutsch, and finally
induced the lady to fix the day on which to make him pure.&nbsp;
Science and business jointly having so taken up his time that he
had learnt but little English, he was at some loss, and left
arrangements to the family of his intended wife.</p>
<p>Not knowing English customs, he had written asking in what
costume he should appear on the great day, and received a letter
telling him to make his appearance at the church duly dressed in
a tall hat, light trousers, and a new frock coat.&nbsp; Frock
coat he read as &ldquo;frac,&rdquo; and ordered wedding garments
such as he thought suitable, with the <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>addition of a brand-new evening
coat.&nbsp; The wedding breakfast having been ordered at the
Hotel Metropole, he there transferred himself, proposing to pass
the night before his final entry into moral life quietly and
decently, as befits one about to change his state.&nbsp; But as
he said, &ldquo;God or some other thing was of another
mind,&rdquo; for when I was arriving at the place, mein head feel
heavy, and I was out of sorts, and when I ring the bell, a
housemaid answer it wit a hot-water jug, and came into the
room.&nbsp; Himmel, what for a girl, black hair like
horse&rsquo;s tail, great glear plue eyes, and tall and fat, it
was a miracle.&nbsp; I fall in love wit her almost at once, but I
say nothings, only wink little at her with my eye.&nbsp; All the
night long I could not schleep, thinking part of the housemaid,
part of mein wife, and part if perhaps I was not going to do a
very silly ding.&nbsp; When it was morning I have quite forgot
the church, but still remember what the clergyman was like.&nbsp;
So I go to the porter (he was a landsman of my own), and ask him
to get me a cab, and then explain, I was to be married oot by
Hampstead way, that morning at eleven and half
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The porter say what church shall I tell the
schelm to drive to, but mein Got I have forgot.&nbsp; So I say,
go to Hampstead, and I will go to all the churches and ask if a
German is to be married, till I find the right one out.&nbsp; The
cabman think that I was mad, and I get into the cab dressed in
clear trousers, white waistcoat, and plue necktie, mit little
spot; <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>shiny new boots that hurt me very much; with yellow
gloves three-quarter-eight in size, and with my new
&ldquo;frac&rdquo; coat, so that I think myself, eh,
Rothenberger, was that really you?&nbsp; The cabman wink mit de
porter, and we start away.&nbsp; We drive and drive, first to one
church and then another, and I always ask, is it in this church
that a German is to be marry at half twelve o&rsquo;clock?&nbsp;
Dey grin at me, and every one say no.&nbsp; De dime approach, and
I was sweating in the cab, not knowing what they say if at half
twelve o&rsquo;clock I not turn up to time.&nbsp; At last looking
out from the window I see the clergyman walking along the street
mit a big hymnbook in his hand.&nbsp; I cry to him, Ach Himmel,
it is I, Karl Rothenberger, that you must marry at half twelve
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He stop, and shomp into the cab, and then we
drive to church.</p>
<p>All was so glad to see me, for I hear one say, I thought the
German must have change his mind.&nbsp; I ran into the church,
and my wife say, What for a costume is it that you have?&nbsp;
Frock coat and clear grey pants, dat is not wedding dress; so I
say I know dat, but why you write to me, mind and buy a new
&ldquo;frac coat&rdquo;?</p>
<p>They mumble out their stuff, and when the clergyman ask me if
I want this woman for mein wife, I say, all right, and all the
people laugh like everythings.&nbsp; Then when he say, I, Karl,
do promise and etcetera, I say, dat is so, and de people laugh
again.&nbsp; At last it all was done, and we drive off to <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>the hotel
to have the breakfast, and mein wife look beautiful in her new
travelling dress.&nbsp; At the hotel the company was met, and I
go up to mein apartment to change the dam frac coat, to wash mein
hands, and put a little brillantine on my moustache, whilst mein
wife mit the bridesmaids go to another room, and all the company
was waiting down below.</p>
<p>I want hot water, so I rang the bell, and the stout pretta
chambermaid she bring it in a jug.&nbsp; How the thing pass I
never knew till now, but I wink at her, and she laugh, and
then&mdash;she put down the jug, just for a moment,&mdash;for the
company, mein wife, her father, and the bridesmaids, all was
waiting down below.&nbsp; So I come down and make mein speech,
talk to the bridesmaids, and we eat like anythings, and then we
drive away to pass our honeymoon, and somehow I feel mein head
much lighter than before.&nbsp; Marriage is good for man, it
sober him, it bring him business, and it bring him children, and
. . .&nbsp; I am happy mit my wife . . .&nbsp; The housemaid, oh
yes, ach Got, I hear that some one take from the place to live
mit him, and it is not a wonder, for she was so tall, so stout,
have such black hair, and such great eyes, it was a pity that she
spend her life answering the bell, and bringing up hot water in a
jug.</p>

class="smcap">The</span> hotel paper had a somewhat misguiding
&ldquo;Comfort&rdquo; as its telegraphic address.&nbsp; Upon the
walls were reproductions of sporting prints by Leech, depicting
scions of the British aristocracy taking their pleasures not so
very sadly after all, and easily demonstrating their superiority
to several smock-frocked rustics by galloping close past them,
and shouting &ldquo;Tally-ho,&rdquo; holding their left ear
between their thumb and finger to emphasize the note.&nbsp;
Apollinaris and whisky splits, Fritz Rupprecht&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Special,&rdquo; with other advertisements of a like
nature, filled up the blanks between the oleographs.&nbsp;
<i>Iron and Commerce</i>, with the <i>Cook&rsquo;s Excursionist
and Engineering</i>, lay untouched upon the tables, serving to
show that if some books be not real books at all, there are
newspapers which are, as it were, but dummies, holding no police
news, football specials, murders, assaults on women, divorce
cases, and other items which the educated public naturally
expects within their sheets.&nbsp; Slipshod and futile, but
attentive German waiters, went about bringing hot whisky, whisky
and soda, whisky and lemonade, and whisky neat <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>to the
belated customers.&nbsp; Upon the tables glasses had made great
rings, commercial travellers had left their pigskin satchels in a
heap, and, by the fire, a group of travellers sat silently
drinking after the Scottish fashion, and spitting in the
grate.&nbsp; Twelve o&rsquo;clock, half-past twelve, then one by
one they dropped away murmuring good-night, and setting down
their glasses with an air of having worked manfully for a good
night&rsquo;s repose.</p>
<p>Still I sat on gazing into the fire, and almost unaware that
on the other side sat a companion of my vigil, till at last he
said, &ldquo;Do you know Yambo, sir?&rdquo; and to my vague
assent rejoined, &ldquo;Yambo on the Arabian coast, just opposite
Hodeida, where vessels in the pilgrim trade discharge their
&lsquo;niggers.&rsquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the port for Mecca, that
is, the &lsquo;Sambaks&rsquo; used to put in there, but now we do
the traffic right from Mogador.&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked with
interest at the man, liking his Demosthenic style of opening
remarks.&nbsp; Tall and broad-shouldered, dressed in navy blue,
boots like small packing-cases, and a green necktie in which was
stuck a cairngorm pin; he wore a silver watch-chain with a small
steering-wheel attached to it; not quite a sailor, yet a look of
the sea about his clothes; he had a face open and innocent, yet
wrinkled round the eyes like a young elephant, and struck me as
being, perhaps not foolish, certainly not wise, but with a tinge
of worldly wisdom gathered in seaport towns, at music-halls, and
other places where those who go down <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>to the sea in ships gain their
experience of life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yambo,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I
thought that Jeddah was the port the pilgrims landed
at.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, so it is,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but I was thinking about Yambo, been there a many times,
used to run arms for the tribes to fight the Turks, when I was
fourth engineer in the old <i>Pyramus</i>.&nbsp; Yes, yes,
I&rsquo;ve been at sea most all my life, though my old dad keeps
a slap-up hotel at Weston-super-Mare.&nbsp; No need to go to sea,
no, but you know some folks would go to hell for pleasure, and I
suppose I&rsquo;m one.&nbsp; Dad, you know&mdash;now were you
ever at Weston-super-Mare?&mdash;is fond of literature, does a
bit himself, Chambers you know; mostly upon the conchology and
the fossils of the South Devon coast; awfully fond of it, and so
am I, nothing I like better than, after getting out of the
engine-room, to lie on deck and read one of Bulwer&rsquo;s books
or Dickens&rsquo;s, both of them stunning.&nbsp; No, I never
write myself.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t make out what set me thinking
about Yambo.&nbsp; What! you won&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Well, waiter,
waiter, Gar&ccedil;ong, as we used to say at Suez, another
whisky, slippy, you know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always been a
temperate man, but like a nightcap before turning in.&nbsp; Perim
ain&rsquo;t so far off from Yambo; ah yes, now I remember what it
was I had to say.&nbsp; You know them Galla girls? prime,
ain&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; But Perim, I remember being Shanghaied
there, nothing to do, a beastly hole; sand, beastly, gets in your
socks, gets in your hair, makes you feel dirty, no matter how you
wash.&nbsp; <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>Well, you know, there were about two hundred of us
there, some kind of Government work was going on, and I was left
there out of my ship, kind of loaned off, you see, to help the
Johnnies at the condensing works.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been at Suez,
Yambo as I told you, Rangoon, down at Talcahuano on the Chilean
coast, wrecked in Smythe&rsquo;s Channel, and been about a bit,
but Perim fairly takes the cake, not even a sheet of
blotting-paper between it and hell.&nbsp; As I was saying, then,
we were cooped up, and not a woman in the place; even the
Government saw it at last, thought maybe worse would happen if
they did nothing, and sent and got six of them Galla girls.&nbsp;
Leastwise, if they didn&rsquo;t send for them, they let a
Levantine, Mirandy was his name, introduce them on the strict
Q.T.&nbsp; Well, you know, the thing was like this, sir&mdash;you
know them Galla girls, black as a boot and skins always as cool
as ice, even in a khamsin; some people says they are better than
white girls; but not in mine; but anyhow they&rsquo;ve got no
&lsquo;Bookay d&rsquo;Afreek&rsquo; about them, it always turns
me sick.&nbsp; As I was saying, I thought I&rsquo;d have a
&lsquo;pasear&rsquo; one evening, so I lemonaded up to the
&lsquo;Mansion,&rsquo; and began talking to one of them girls,
sort of to pass the time.&nbsp; Serpent upon the rocks, eh? well,
that old Solomon knew something about girls.&nbsp; Now here comes
in the curious thing, it always strikes me just as if I&rsquo;d
read it in a book; Dickens now or Thackeray could have
&rsquo;andled it, Bulwer would &rsquo;ave made it a little <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>loosious.&nbsp; Just as the gal was taking off her
things&mdash;oh, no offence, captain, I&rsquo;m telling you the
thing just as it happened&mdash;I saw she had a crucifix
a-hanging round her neck.&nbsp; Papist?&nbsp; Oh no, not much;
father, he sat under Rev. Hiles Hitchens, light of the
Congregationalists.&nbsp; No, no, nothing to do with Rome, never
could bear the influence of the confessor in a family.&nbsp; A
little free myself, especially below latitude forty, but at
&rsquo;ome and in the family I like things ship-shape.&nbsp;
Well, as I said, round her black neck she had a silver crucifix,
contrast of colour made the thing stand out double the
size.&nbsp; Ses I, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; and she says,
&lsquo;Klistian girl, Johnny, me Klistian all the same
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; That was a stopper over all, and I just reached
for my hat, says, &lsquo;Klistian are yer,&rsquo; and I gave her
two of them Spanish dollars and a kiss, and quit the place.&nbsp;
What did she say?&nbsp; Why, nothing, looked at me and laughed,
and says, &lsquo;You Klistian, Johnny, plenty much damn
fool.&rsquo;&nbsp; No, I don&rsquo;t know what she meant, I done
my duty, and that&rsquo;s all I am concerned about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another half, just a split whisky and
Apollinaris.&nbsp; Well, if you won&rsquo;t, good-night;&rdquo;
and the door slammed, leaving me gazing at the fast-blackening
fire.</p>

235</span>SOHAIL</h2>
<p><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span><span
class="smcap">Sohail</span> is the Arabic name of the star
Canopus, to which a curious belief belongs.&nbsp; It appears that
in some fashion, known alone to Allah, the fate of the Arab race
is bound up with the star.&nbsp; Where it sheds its light their
empire flourishes, and there alone.&nbsp; Wherefore or why the
thing is so, no true believer seems to know, but that it is so he
is well aware, and that suffices him.</p>
<p>Questionings and doubts, changes of costume and religion,
striving for ideals, improvements, telegraphs and telephones, are
well enough for Christians, whose lives are passed in hurry and
in hunting after gold.&nbsp; For those who have changed but
little for the last two thousand years, in dress, in faith and
customs, it is enough to know it is a talismanic star.&nbsp; Let
star-gazers and those who deal in books, dub the star Alpha (or
Beta) Argo, it is all one to Arabs.&nbsp; If you question
knowledge, say the Easterns, it falls from its estate.&nbsp; If
this is so the empiric method has much to answer for.&nbsp;
Knowledge and virtue and a horse&rsquo;s mouth should not pass
through too many hands.&nbsp; Knowledge is absolute, and even
argument but dulls it, and strips <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>it of its authenticity, as the bloom
of a ripe peach is lost, almost by looking on it.</p>
<p>Of one thing there can be no doubt.&nbsp; When in the Yemen,
ages before the first historian penned the fable known as
history, the Arabs, watching their flocks, observed Sohail, it
seems to have struck them as a star differing from all the
rest.</p>
<p>Al-Makkari writes of it on several occasions.&nbsp; The
Dervish Abderahman Sufi of Rai, in his <i>Introduction to the
Starry Heavens</i>, remarks that, at the feet of Sohail is seen,
in the neighbourhood of Bagdad, a &ldquo;curious white
spot.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;curious white spot&rdquo;
astronomers have thought to be the greater of the two Magellan
clouds.&nbsp; Perhaps it is so, but I doubt if the Arabs, as a
race, were concerned about the matter, so that they saw the
star.</p>
<p>From wandering warring tribes Mohammed made a nation of
them.&nbsp; Mohammed died and joined the wife in paradise, of
whom he said, &ldquo;By Allah, she shall sit at my right hand,
because when all men laughed she clave to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
came Othman, Ali, and the rest, and led them into other lands, to
Irak, Damascus, El Hind, to Ifrikia, lastly to Spain, and still
their empire waxed, even across the &ldquo;black waters&rdquo; of
the seas, and still Sohail was there to shine upon them.&nbsp; In
the great adventure, one of the few in which a people has
engaged; when first Tarik landed his Berbers on the rock which
bears his name; at the battle on <a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>the Guadalete where the king, Don
Roderick, disappeared from the eyes of men, leaving his golden
sandals by a stream; to Seville, Cordoba, and Murcia, the land of
Teodmir ben Gobdos, to which the Arabs gave the name of Masr,
right up to Zaragoza, Sohail accompanied the host.&nbsp; A
curious host it must have been with Muza riding on a mule, and
with but two-and-twenty camels to carry all its baggage.&nbsp;
From Jativa to Huesca of the Bell, where King Ramiro, at the
instigation of Abbot Frotardo (a learned man), cut off his
nobles&rsquo; heads as they were poppies in a field, they
followed it across the Pyrenees, halting at the spot where from
his &ldquo;Camp in Aquitaine&rdquo; Muza dispatched a messenger
to Rome to tell the Pope that he was coming to take him by the
beard if he refused Islam.&nbsp; Then the wise men (who always
march with armies), looking aloft at night, declared the star was
lost.&nbsp; Although they smote the Christian dogs, taking their
lands, their daughters, horses, and their gold, on several
occasions as Allah willed it, yet victory was not so stable as in
Spain.&nbsp; Perhaps beyond the mountains their spirits fell from
lack of sun, or their horses sickened in the fat plains of
France.</p>
<p>Then the conquering tide had spent itself and flowed back into
Spain; at Zaragoza the first Moorish kingdom rose.&nbsp;
Al-Makkari writes that at that time Sohail was visible in Upper
Aragon, but low on the horizon.&nbsp; Again the Christians <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>conquered,
and the royal race of Aben Hud fled from the city.&nbsp; Ibn
Jaldun relates that, shortly afterwards, Sohail became invisible
from Aragon.&nbsp; The Cid, Rodrigo Diaz, he of Vivar (may God
remember him), prevailed against Valencia, and from thence the
star, indignant, took its departure.&nbsp; And so of Jativa, Beni
Carlo, and Alpuixech.</p>
<p>Little by little Elche, with its palm-woods, and even Murcia
bade it good-bye, as one by one, in the centuries of strife, the
Christians in succession conquered each one of them.&nbsp; At
last the belief gained ground that, only at one place in Spain,
called from the circumstance Sohail, could the star be
seen.&nbsp; At Fuengirola, between Malaga and Marbella, still
stands the little town the Arabs called Sohail, lost amongst
sand-hills, looking across at Africa, of which it seems to form a
part; cactus and olive, cane-brake and date palms, its chiefest
vegetation; in summer, hot as Bagdad, in winter, sheltered from
the winds which come from Christendom by the Sierras of the
Alpujarra and Segura.&nbsp; Surely there the star would stop, and
let the Arab power flourish under its influence, and there for
centuries it did stand stationary.&nbsp; The City of the
Pomegranate was founded, the Alhambra, with its brilliant court,
the Generalife; and poets, travellers, and men of science
gathered at Granada, Cordoba, and at Isbilieh.&nbsp; Ab-Motacim,
the poet king of Cordoba, planted the hills with almond trees, to
give the effect of snow, which Romaiquia longed <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>for.&nbsp;
He wrote his <i>Kasidas</i>, and filled the courtyard full of
spices and sugar for his queen to trample on, when she saw the
women of the brick-makers kneading the clay with naked feet, and
found her riches but a burden to her.&nbsp; Averroes and
Avicenna, the doctors of medicine and of law, laid down their
foolish rules of practice and of conduct, and all went
well.&nbsp; Medina-el-Azahra, now a pile of stones where
shepherds sleep or make believe to watch their sheep, where once
the Caliph entertained the ambassador from Constantinople,
showing him the golden basin full of quicksilver, &ldquo;like a
great ocean,&rdquo; rose from the arid hills, and seemed
eternal.&nbsp; Allah appeared to smile upon his people, and in
proof of it let his star shine.&nbsp; Jehovah though was
jealous.&nbsp; A jealous God, evolved by Jews and taken upon
trust by Christians, could not endure the empire of Islam.&nbsp;
Again town after town was conquered, Baeza, Loja, Antequera,
Guadix and Velez-Malaga, even Alhama (Woe is me, Alhama), lastly
Granada.&nbsp; Then came the kingdom of the Alpujarra, with the
persecutions and the rebellions, Arabs and Christians fighting
like wolves and torturing one another for the love of their
respective Gods.&nbsp; Yet the star lingered on at Fuengirola,
and whilst it still was seen hope was not lost.&nbsp; A century
elapsed, and from Gibraltar&mdash;from the spot where first they
landed&mdash;the last Moors embarked.&nbsp; In Spain, where once
they ruled from Jaca to Tarifa, no Moor <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>was
left.&nbsp; Perhaps about the mountain villages of Ronda a few
remained, but christianized by force, the sword and faggot ever
the best spurs to the true faith.&nbsp; But they were not the
folk to think of stars or legends, so that no one (of the true
faith) could say whether Sohail still lingered over Spain.</p>
<p>Trains, telegraphs, and phonographs, elections and debates in
parliament, with clothes unsuited to the people they deform, give
a false air of Europe to the land.&nbsp; The palm-trees, cactus,
canes, and olives, the tapia walls, the women&rsquo;s walk and
eyes, the horses&rsquo; paces, and the fatalistic air which hangs
on everything, give them the lie direct.&nbsp; The empire of the
Arabs, though departed, yet retains its hold.&nbsp; The hands
that built the mosque at Cordoba, the Giralda, the Alhambra, and
almost every parish church in Southern Spain, from ruined
aqueduct and mosque, sign to the Christian half derisively.&nbsp;
So all the land from the gaunt northern mountains to the hot
swamps along the Guad-el-Kebir (stretching from Seville to San
Lucar) is part of Africa.&nbsp; The reasons are set forth
lengthily by the ethnographers, economists, and the grave foolish
rout of those who write for people who know nothing, of what they
do not understand themselves.</p>
<p>But the star&rsquo;s lingering is the real cause, and whilst
it lingers things can never really go on in Spain as they go on
in England, where gloom obscures all stars.&nbsp; The Arabs,
issuing from the desert like the khamsin, came, conquered, and <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>possessed,
their star shone on them, and its rays sank deep into the
land.&nbsp; Their empire waned, and they, retreating, disappeared
into the sands from whence they sprang.&nbsp; Spain knows them
not, but yet their influence remains.&nbsp; Only at Cadiz can the
talisman be seen, shining low down on the horizon, and still
waiting till the precession of the equinoxes takes it across the
Straits.&nbsp; Let it recross, and shine upon the old wild life
of the vast plains, upon the horsemen flying on the sands,
whirling and circling like gulls, whilst the veiled women raise
the joyous cry which pierces ears and soul; upon the solemn
stately men who sit and look at nothing all a summer&rsquo;s day,
and above all upon the waveless inland sea men call the
Sahara.</p>
<p>There may it shine for ever on the life unchanged since the
Moalakat, when first the rude astronomers observed the talisman
and framed the legend on some starry night, all seated on the
ground.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
